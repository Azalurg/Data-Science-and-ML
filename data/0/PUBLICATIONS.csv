2,QSOX1 expression is associated with aggressive tumor features and reduced survival in breast carcinomas.,27562495,"Modern pathology : an official journal of the United States and Canadian Academy of Pathology, Inc. Volume: 29 Issue: 12 12 2016",2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27562495/,"The biological role of quiescin sulfhydryl oxidase 1 (QSOX1) in tumor development is not well known, and its relation to breast cancer progression and prognosis is controversial. Here, our aim was to study the expression pattern and prognostic impact of QSOX1 in breast cancer, in relation to molecular subgroups and tumor cell proliferation. We examined a population-based series as part of the prospective Norwegian Breast Cancer Screening Program, including all women (50-69 years) diagnosed with breast cancer in one county of Norway during 1996-2003. QSOX1 expression was assessed by immunohistochemistry on tissue microarrays (n=458). Median follow-up time was 13 years. High expression of QSOX1 protein was associated with features of poor prognosis including high histologic grade, hormone receptor negativity, HER2 positivity, and increased tumor cell proliferation. High QSOX1 expression was further associated with reduced breast cancer-specific survival in both univariate and multivariate analysis, independent of molecular subtypes. High QSOX1 expression is a strong and independent factor of reduced survival in breast cancer, also reflected by elevated levels in more aggressive molecular subgroups. QSOX1 expression may represent a biomarker for aggressive disease and a potential treatment target."
3,Clinical Significance of Late Enhancement and Regional Wall Remodeling Assessed by 3T Magnetic Resonance Imaging.,25922586,Clinical Medicine Insights. Cardiology. Volume: 9 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25922586/,"Clinical follow-up studies comparing left ventricular (LV) function and late gadolinium enhancement (LGE) by high-field 3T cardiac magnetic resonance (CMR) are of general interest due to the increased use of 3T scanners.

4,Metabolic re-wiring of isogenic breast epithelial cell lines following epithelial to mesenchymal transition.,28323032,Cancer letters. Volume: 396 06 28 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28323032/,"Epithelial to mesenchymal transition (EMT) has implications in tumor progression and metastasis. Metabolic alterations have been described in cancer development but studies focused on the metabolic re-wiring that takes place during EMT are still limited. We performed metabolomics profiling of a breast epithelial cell line and its EMT derived mesenchymal phenotype to create genome-scale metabolic models descriptive of both cell lines. Glycolysis and OXPHOS were higher in the epithelial phenotype while amino acid anaplerosis and fatty acid oxidation fueled the mesenchymal phenotype. Through comparative bioinformatics analysis, PPAR-γ1, PPAR- γ2 and AP-1 were found to be the most influential transcription factors associated with metabolic re-wiring. In silico gene essentiality analysis predicts that the LAT1 neutral amino acid transporter is essential for mesenchymal cell survival. Our results define metabolic traits that distinguish an EMT derived mesenchymal cell line from its epithelial progenitor and may have implications in cancer progression and metastasis. Furthermore, the tools presented here can aid in identifying critical metabolic nodes that may serve as therapeutic targets aiming to prevent EMT and inhibit metastatic dissemination."

7,Structural decomposition of decadal climate prediction errors: A Bayesian approach.,28993698,Scientific reports. Volume: 7 Issue: 1 Oct 09 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28993698/,"Decadal climate predictions use initialized coupled model simulations that are typically affected by a drift toward a biased climatology determined by systematic model errors. Model drifts thus reflect a fundamental source of uncertainty in decadal climate predictions. However, their analysis has so far relied on ad-hoc assessments of empirical and subjective character. Here, we define the climate model drift as a dynamical process rather than a descriptive diagnostic. A unified statistical Bayesian framework is proposed where a state-space model is used to decompose systematic decadal climate prediction errors into an initial drift, seasonally varying climatological biases and additional effects of co-varying climate processes. An application to tropical and south Atlantic sea-surface temperatures illustrates how the method allows to evaluate and elucidate dynamic interdependencies between drift, biases, hindcast residuals and background climate. Our approach thus offers a methodology for objective, quantitative and explanatory error estimation in climate predictions."

9,Reflections during a study on family therapy with drug addicts.,2209830,Family process. Volume: 29 Issue: 3 Sep 1990,1990,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2209830/,"This article presents ideas and reflections emerging during a project on family therapy with drug abusers. Initially inspired by the writings of Stanton and Todd on the subject, the project developed into a recursive and self-reflective process, characterized by increasing doubts about the usefulness of categorization of families, of pre-planning therapy, and of the therapist as an ""expert."" The limitations of approaches that emphasize the importance of understanding the family structure as the basis for changing it are discussed, particularly with respect to how they decrease therapist flexibility and may block the family's finding their own solution. Alternative approaches to practice and research are also discussed, bearing on ideas particularly formulated by theoreticians and practitioners inspired by second-order cybernetics."

11,Processing of sub-syllabic speech units in the posterior temporal lobe: an fMRI study.,15894493,NeuroImage. Volume: 26 Issue: 4 Jul 15 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15894493/,"The objective of this study was to investigate phonological processing in the brain by using sub-syllabic speech units with rapidly changing frequency spectra. We used isolated stop consonants extracted from natural speech consonant-vowel (CV) syllables, which were digitized and presented through headphones in a functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) paradigm. The stop consonants were contrasted with CV syllables. In order to control for general auditory activation, we used duration- and intensity-matched noise as a third stimulus category. The subjects were seventeen right-handed, healthy male volunteers. BOLD activation responses were acquired on a 1.5-T MR scanner. The auditory stimuli were presented through MR compatible headphones, using an fMRI paradigm with clustered volume acquisition and 12 s repetition time. The consonant vs. noise comparison resulted in unilateral left lateralized activation in the posterior part of the middle temporal gyrus and superior temporal sulcus (MTG/STS). The CV syllable vs. noise comparison resulted in bilateral activation in the same regions, with a leftward asymmetry. The reversed comparisons, i.e., noise vs. speech stimuli, resulted in right hemisphere activation in the supramarginal and superior temporal gyrus, as well as right prefrontal activation. Since the consonant stimuli are unlikely to have activated a semantic-lexical processing system, it seems reasonable to assume that the MTG/STS activation represents phonetic/phonological processing. This may involve the processing of both spectral and temporal features considered important for phonetic encoding."

13,Psychometric Limitations of the Center for Epidemiologic Studies-Depression Scale for Assessing Depressive Symptoms among Adults with HIV/AIDS: A Rasch Analysis.,27042347,Depression research and treatment. Volume: 2016 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27042347/,"The Center for Epidemiological Studies-Depression (CES-D) scale is a widely used measure of depressive symptoms, but its psychometric properties have not been adequately evaluated among adults with HIV/AIDS. This study used an item response theory approach (Rasch analysis) to evaluate the CES-D's validity and reliability in relation to key demographic and clinical variables in adults with HIV/AIDS. A convenience sample of 347 adults with HIV/AIDS (231 males, 93 females, and 23 transgenders; age range 22-77 years) completed the CES-D. A Rasch model application was used to analyze the CES-D's rating scale functioning, internal scale validity, person-response validity, person-separation validity, internal consistency, differential item functioning (DIF), and differential test functioning. CES-D scores were generally high and associated with several demographic and clinical variables. The CES-D distinguished 3 distinct levels of depression and had acceptable internal consistency but lacked unidimensionality, five items demonstrated poor fit to the model, 15% of the respondents demonstrated poor fit, and eight items demonstrated DIF related to gender, race, or AIDS diagnosis. Removal of misfitting items resulted in minimal improvement in the CES-D's substantive and structural validity. CES-D scores should be interpreted with caution in adults with HIV/AIDS, particularly when comparing scores across gender and racial groups. "
14,Investigations of a novel process to the framework of benzo[c]cinnoline.,15498002,The Journal of organic chemistry. Volume: 69 Issue: 22 Oct 29 2004,2004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15498002/,"A novel synthetic process leading to the framework of benzo[c]cinnoline has been discovered and investigated. The process is composed of two separate reactions, the first of which is a partial reduction of the nitro groups of the 2,2'-dinitrobiphenyl, a process that we believe proceeds via a SET mechanism to yield the hydroxyamino and nitroso groups. In the following step the cyclization takes place under formation of the -N=N- bond. We believe that this process take place via a radical mechanism through the nitroso radical anion. The novel process affords either benzo[c]cinnoline or benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide, both in high yields, 93% and 91%, respectively. To obtain benzo[c]cinnoline, the reaction is conducted with an alcohol as solvent and an alkoxide as the base, while for benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide, water is used as solvent with sodium hydroxide as the base. To establish the latter procedure, statistical experimental design and multivariate modeling were utilized to reveal the response surface for the reaction and to determine the optimal conditions for the reaction. A proposal for the complex reaction mechanism is given. During the corroboration of the mechanism, a new deoxygenation reaction for converting benzo[c]cinnoline N-oxide into benzo[c]cinnoline was discovered. The reaction is conducted by treating the N-oxide with sodium ethoxide at elevated temperature to achieve near-quantitative conversion into benzo[c]cinnoline in a yield of 96%."
15,High doses of laser phototherapy can increase proliferation in melanoma stromal connective tissue.,29623521,Lasers in medical science. Volume: 33 Issue: 6 Aug 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29623521/,"It is well established that laser phototherapy (LP) is contraindicated directly over cancer cells, due to its bio modulatory effects in cell and blood vessel proliferation. The aim of the present study was to analyze the influence of typical low-level laser therapy (LLLT) and high intensity laser therapy (HILT) and an in-between dose of 9 J on collagen fibers and blood vessels content in melanoma tumors (B16F10) implanted in mice. Melanoma tumor cells were injected in male Balb C mice which were distributed in four groups: control (no irradiated) or irradiated by 3, 9, or 21 J (150; 450, or 1050 J/cm2). LP was performed in daily sessions for 3 days with a InGaAlP-660 nm (mean output: 50 mW, spot size: 2 mm2). Tumor volume was analyzed using (1) picrosirius staining to quantify collagen fibers content and (2) Verhoeff's method to quantify blood vessels content. Tumor growth outcome measured in the 3-J group was not significantly different from controls. Nine and 21-J groups, presented significant and dose-dependent increases in tumor volume. Quantitative analysis of the intensity of collagen fibers and their organization in stroma and peri-tumoral microenvironment showed significant differences between irradiated and control group. Blood vessels count of 21-J group outnumbered the other groups. High doses (≥ 9 J) of LP showed a dose-dependent tumor growth, different collagen fibers characteristics, and eventually blood vessel growth, while a typical LLLT dose (3 J) appeared harmless on melanoma cell activity."
16,Spatio-temporal variability of richness estimators: coastal marine fish communities as examples.,15800740,Oecologia. Volume: 144 Issue: 2 Jun 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15800740/,"We assessed the performance of two estimators of species richness, the Chao2 and the Coleman 'random placement curve'. Using a dataset of intertidal fish from the Norwegian Skagerrak coast, we found that Chao2 was effective for low sampling intensity, often reaching asymptotic values for few samples, but for higher sampling intensity the performance deteriorated. For large samples, the Coleman random placement curve was more effective than the Chao2 estimates when comparing spatio-temporal patterns of species richness. Spatial patterns were clearly and consistently identified by both methods, whereas the coastal fish communities displayed too much variability in the early summer for any sensible measure of temporal patterns of fish-species richness to be made. To control for spurious results due to systematic differences in mean abundance of the samples the analyses were performed also on data standardised by the number of individuals in the samples, without any significant change in the results. We conclude that modest sampling effort is sufficient to characterise spatial patterns of coastal fish-species richness, while a detailed and high-precision description of seasonal patterns could not be obtained with any reasonable sampling effort."

18,Inherited primary failure of eruption in the primary dentition: report of five cases.,9096818,ASDC journal of dentistry for children. Volume: 64 Issue: 1,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9096818/,"Unerupted primary teeth are a rare event and in most cases involve the second primary molars. The impaction may be primary, meaning that the teeth never have been erupted (also called primary failure of eruption), or it may be secondary, meaning that the teeth after eruption are reimpacted. The present report describes five cases (three boys and two girls) with primary failure of eruption of totally fourteen second primary molars. None of these teeth ever erupted and were removed surgically at an age of 10-11 yrs. Additionally, in all five cases the eruption of the entire permanent dentition was severely retarded. Consequences of the nonerupting primary molars put a more functional strain, with severe attrition, on the remaining teeth. The unerupted primary molars also seemed to prevent the development of the corresponding premolars. In addition the impacted primary molars were in some cases a threat to the eruption of first permanent molars. The etiology of the present primary failure of eruption seems to be inheritance, and the mode of transmission is judged to be autosomal dominant."
19,Ligand Noninnocence in Coinage Metal Corroles: A Silver Knife-Edge.,26345592,"Chemistry (Weinheim an der Bergstrasse, Germany). Volume: 21 Issue: 47 Nov 16 2015",2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26345592/,"A silver β-octabromo-meso-triarylcorrole has been found to exhibit a strongly saddled geometry, providing the first instance of a strongly saddled corrole complex involving a metal other than copper. The Soret maxima of the Ag octabromocorroles also redshift markedly in response to increasingly electron-donating para substituents on the meso-aryl groups. In both these respects, the Ag octabromocorroles differ from simple Ag triarylcorrole derivatives, which exhibit only mild saddling and substituent-insensitive Soret maxima. These results have been rationalized in terms of an innocent M(III)-corrole(3-) description for the simple Ag corroles and a noninnocent M(II)-corrole(·2-) description for the Ag octabromocorroles. In contrast, all copper corroles are thought to be noninnocent, while all gold corroles are innocent. Uniquely among metallocorroles, silver corroles thus seem poised on a knife-edge, so to speak, between innocent and noninnocent electronic structures and may tip either way, depending on the exact nature of the corrole ligand."
20,Benefit of a stroke unit: a randomized controlled trial.,1866749,Stroke. Volume: 22 Issue: 8 Aug 1991,1991,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1866749/,"In a randomized controlled trial we compared the clinical outcome of acute stroke patients, 110 of whom were allocated to treatment in a stroke unit and 110 to treatment in general medical wards. No significant difference existed between these groups with regard to sex, age, marital status, medical history, or functional impairment on admission. Outcome was measured at 6 and 52 weeks after the stroke by the proportion of patients at home, the proportion of patients in an institution, the mortality, and the functional state. After 6 weeks 56.4% of the patients randomized to the stroke unit and 32.7% of the patients randomized to the general medical wards were at home (p = 0.0004), and after 52 weeks 62.7% and 44.6%, respectively, were at home (p = 0.002). After 6 weeks 36.3% of the patients from the stroke unit and 50.0% from the general medical wards were in an institution (p = 0.02); after 52 weeks 12.7% and 22.7%, respectively, were institutionalized (p = 0.016). After 6 weeks mortality was 7.3% for the stroke unit group and 17.3% for the general medical wards group (p = 0.027). After 52 weeks mortality was 24.6% for the stroke unit group and 32.7% for the general medical wards group (difference not significant). Functional state was significantly better for patients treated in the stroke unit after both 6 and 52 weeks. We conclude that care of patients with acute stroke in a stroke unit improves clinical outcome compared with treatment in general medical wards."

We demonstrated synergism between Lf-cin B and erythromycin against E. coli, and partial synergism between Lf-cin B and penicillin G, vancomycin and gentamicin against E. coli. Only penicillin G acted in partial synergism with Lf-cin B against S. aureus. Lf-cin B antagonized vancomycin and gentamicin against S. aureus in low concentration. We conclude that Lf-cin B may facilitate the uptake of antibiotics across the cell envelope."
24,Characteristics of patients frequently subjected to pharmacological and mechanical restraint--a register study in three Norwegian acute psychiatric wards.,24230996,Psychiatry research. Volume: 215 Issue: 1 Jan 30 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24230996/,"This retrospective study from three catchment-area-based acute psychiatric wards showed that of all the pharmacologically and mechanically restrained patients (n=373) 34 (9.1%) had been frequently restrained (6 or more times). These patients accounted for 39.2% of all restraint episodes during the two-year study period. Adjusted binary logistic regression analyses showed that the odds for being frequently restrained were 91% lower among patients above 50 years compared to those aged 18-29 years; a threefold increase (OR=3.1) for those admitted 3 times or more compared to patients with only one stay; and, finally, a threefold increase (OR=3.1) if the length of stay was 16 days or more compared to those admitted for 0-4 days. Among frequently restrained patients, males (n=15) had significantly longer stays than women (n=19), and 8 of the females had a diagnosis of personality disorder, compared to none among males. Our study showed that being frequently restrained was associated with long inpatient stay, many admissions and young age. Teasing out patient characteristics associated with the risk of being frequently restraint may contribute to reduce use of restraint by developing alternative interventions for these patients. "
25,The effect of trichlorfon and other organophosphates on prenatal brain development in the guinea pig.,8065512,Neurochemical research. Volume: 19 Issue: 5 May 1994,1994,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8065512/,"The organophosphates trichlorfon, dichlorvos, dimethoate, soman, triortho-cresyl phosphate (TOCP), and the diethoxy-analogue of trichlorfon (O,O-diethyl 2,2,2-trichloro-1-hydroxyethylphosphonate, ethyl-trichlorfon), were administered to guinea pigs between day 42 and 46 of gestation. When the offsprings were examined at birth, there was a severe reduction in brain weight in the case of trichlorfon and dichlorvos, but not after treatment with the other organophosphates. The reduction in weight was most pronounced for cerebellum, medulla oblongata, thalamus/hypothalamus and quadrigemina. The effect was less marked for cerebral cortex and hippocampus. Since soman, a potent anticholinesterase, and TOCP, an inhibitor of neuropathy target esterase, did not show any effects, this excludes that the brain hypoplasia can be caused by inhibition of these two enzymes. Further, the lack of effect with ethyl-trichlorfon has shed some light on the part of the trichlorfon molecule which could be involved in the formation of the hypoplasia. It is suggested that alkylation of DNA may be involved in the development of the lesion. The possible consequences for a teratogenic effect of trichlorfon and dichlorvos on humans are discussed."

28,Proteomic Investigation of the Response of Enterococcus faecalis V583 when Cultivated in Urine.,25915650,PloS one. Volume: 10 Issue: 4 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25915650/,"Enterococcus faecalis is a robust bacterium, which is able to survive in and adapt to hostile environments such as the urinary tract and bladder. In this label-free quantitative proteomic study based on MaxQuant LFQ algorithms, we identified 127 proteins present in the secretome of the clinical vancomycin-resistant isolate E. faecalis V583 and we compared proteins secreted in the initial phase of cultivation in urine with the secretome during cultivation in standard laboratory medium, 2xYT. Of the 54 identified proteins predicted to be secreted, six were exclusively found after cultivation in urine including the virulence factor EfaA (""endocarditis specific antigen"") and its homologue EF0577 (""adhesion lipoprotein""). These two proteins are both involved in manganese transport, known to be an important determinant of colonization and infection, and may additionally function as adhesins. Other detected urine-specific proteins are involved in peptide transport (EF0063 and EF3106) and protease inhibition (EF3054). In addition, we found an uncharacterized protein (EF0764), which had not previously been linked to the adaptation of V583 to a urine environment, and which is unique to E. faecalis. Proteins found in both environments included a histone-like protein, EF1550, that was up-regulated during cultivation in urine and that has a homologue in streptococci (HlpA) known to be involved in bacterial adhesion to host cells. Up-regulated secreted proteins included autolysins. These results from secretome analyses are largely compatible with previously published data from transcriptomics studies. All in all, the present data indicate that transport, in particular metal transport, adhesion, cell wall remodelling and the unknown function carried out by the unique EF0764 are important for enterococcal adaptation to the urine environment. These results provide a basis for a more targeted exploration of novel proteins involved in the adaptability and pathogenicity of E. faecalis. "

Volume: 8 Feb 25 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18298815/,"Retroviruses are widely used to transfer genes to mammalian cells efficiently and stably. However, genetic elements required for high-level gene expression are incompatible with standard systems. The retroviral RNA genome is produced by cellular transcription and post-transcriptional processing within packaging cells: Introns present in the retroviral genomic transcript are removed by splicing, while polyadenylation signals lead to the production of ineffective truncated genomes.

Volume: 9 Issue: 11 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25372461/,"Gillnet sampling and analyses of otolith shape, vertebral count and growth indicated the presence of three putative Atlantic herring (Clupea harengus L.) populations mixing together over the spawning season February-June inside and outside an inland brackish water lake (Landvikvannet) in southern Norway. Peak spawning of oceanic Norwegian spring spawners and coastal Skagerrak spring spawners occurred in March-April with small proportions of spawners entering the lake. In comparison, spawning of Landvik herring peaked in May-June with high proportions found inside the lake, which could be explained by local adaptations to the environmental conditions and seasonal changes of this marginal habitat. The 1.85 km(2) lake was characterized by oxygen depletion occurring between 2.5 and 5 m depth between March and June. This was followed by changes in salinity from 1-7‰ in the 0-1 m surface layer to levels of 20-25‰ deeper than 10 m. In comparison, outside the 3 km long narrow channel connecting the lake with the neighboring fjord, no anoxic conditions were found. Here salinity in the surface layer increased over the season from 10 to 25‰, whereas deeper than 5 m it was stable at around 35‰. Temperature at 0-5 m depth increased significantly over the season in both habitats, from 7 to 14 °C outside and 5 to 17 °C inside the lake. Despite differences in peak spawning and utilization of the lake habitat between the three putative populations, there was an apparent temporal and spatial overlap in spawning stages suggesting potential interbreeding in accordance with the metapopulation concept."

Hexaminolevulinate (HAL)-induced protoporphyrin-IX is a potent photosensitizer that localizes at membranous structures outside of the nucleus of a cell. HAL-mediated photodynamic therapy selectively destroys activated/transformed lymphocytes and induces systemic anti-tumor immunity.

In spite of frequent delay in skeletal maturation at diagnosis, the delay in mean bone age at a mean chronological age of 1.5 years was slight (0.5 months), and 30% of the variation in bone age SD score (SDS) at 1.5 years was accounted for by the dose of L-thyroxine and serum thyroxine during the first year. The children with a bone age within +/- 1 SDS had a prescribed mean dose of L-thyroxine per kg body weight from 3 to 12 months of age of 5.4 +/- 1.7 micrograms/kg/day, and their mean serum thyroxine concentration during the first year was 175 +/- 29 nmol/l. We conclude that bone age at 1.5 years of age was positively correlated with the dose of L-thyroxine and the serum thyroxine concentrations during the first year. This supports the general use of bone age assessments as a complement to other treatment variables in the follow-up of children with congenital hypothyroidism."

Titanium contents equivalent to approximately 5 g feed were eliminated from the gizzard per hour independently of whether ground or whole wheat was used. Thus, a hypothesis that the use of whole grain would slow down passage rate through the upper digestive tract was not supported by the current results."

Even a majority of those who reported having used cannabis themselves said that all use should be prohibited. A comparison of the crime of possessing quite a small quantity of cannabis with other commonplace violations of the law showed that the drug offence was considered a serious crime. Although the penalties for drug offences have been raised dramatically several times since the end of the 1960s, a majority still said that the punishment prescribed by the Norwegian law for being involved with drugs is too mild."

This study is an exploratory research comparing the genome-wide expression profile in whole-blood samples according to HRT use. Within the Norwegian Women and Cancer study, 100 postmenopausal women (50 HRT users and 50 non-HRT users) born between 1943 and 1949 with normal to high body mass index and no other medication use were selected. After total RNA extraction, amplification, and labeling, the samples were hybridized together with a common reference (Universal human reference RNA, Stratagen) to Agilent Human 1A oligoarrays (G4110b, Agilent Technologies) containing 20,173 unique genes. Differentially expressed genes were used to build a classifier using the nearest shrunken centroid method (PAM). Then, we tested the significant changes in single genes by different methods like t test, Significance Analysis of Microarrays, and Bayesian ANOVA analysis. Results did not reveal any distinct gene list which predicted accurately HRT exposure (error rate, 0.40). Classifier performance slightly improved (error rate, 0.26) including only women who were using continuous combined HRT treatment. According to the small amplitude of expression alterations observed in whole blood, more quantitative technique and larger sample sizes will be needed to be able to investigate whether significant single genes are differentially expressed in HRT versus non-HRT users. Taken cautiously, significant enrichments in biological process of genes with small changes after HRT use were observed (e.g., receptor and transporter activities, immune response, frizzled signaling pathway, actin filament organization, and glycogen metabolism)."

43,LTX-109 is a novel agent for nasal decolonization of methicillin-resistant and -sensitive Staphylococcus aureus.,25331699,Antimicrobial agents and chemotherapy. Volume: 59 Issue: 1 Jan 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25331699/,"Nasal decolonization has a proven effect on the prevention of severe Staphylococcus aureus infections and the control of methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). However, rising rates of resistance to antibiotics highlight the need for new substances for nasal decolonization. LTX-109 is a broad-spectrum, fast-acting bactericidal antimicrobial drug for topical treatment, which causes membrane disruption and cell lysis. This mechanism of action is not associated with cross-resistance and has a low propensity for development of resistance. In the present study, persistent nasal MRSA and methicillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) carriers were treated for 3 days with vehicle or with 1%, 2%, or 5% LTX-109. A significant effect on nasal decolonization was observed already after 2 days of LTX-109 treatment in subjects treated with 2% or 5% LTX-109 compared to vehicle (P ≤ 0.0012 by Dunnett's test). No safety issues were noted during the 9-week follow-up period. Minimal reversible epithelial lesions were observed in the nasal cavity. The systemic exposure was very low, with a maximum concentration of drug in plasma (Cmax) at 1 to 2 h postdosing (3.72 to 11.7 ng/ml). One week after treatment initiation, LTX-109 was not detectable in any subject. Intranasal treatment of S. aureus with LTX-109 is safe and reduces the bacterial load already after a single day of treatment. Hence, LTX-109 has potential as a new and effective antimicrobial agent with a low propensity of resistance development that can prevent infections by MSSA/MRSA during hospitalization.

Volume: 108 Issue: 1 Dec 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12923626/,"A genetic linkage map has been constructed for meadow fescue ( Festuca pratensis Huds.) (2n=2 x=14) using a full-sib family of a cross between a genotype from a Norwegian population (HF2) and a genotype from a Yugoslavian cultivar (B14). The two-way pseudo-testcross procedure has been used to develop separate maps for each parent, as well as a combined map. A total number of 550 loci have been mapped using homologous and heterologous RFLPs, AFLPs, isozymes and SSRs. The combined map consists of 466 markers, has a total length of 658.8 cM with an average marker density of 1.4 cM/marker. A high degree of orthology and colinearity was observed between meadow fescue and the Triticeae genome(s) for all linkage groups, and the individual linkage groups were designated 1F-7F in accordance with the orthologous Triticeae chromosomes. As expected, the meadow fescue linkage groups were highly orthologous and co-linear with Lolium, and with oat, maize and sorghum, generally in the same manner as the Triticeae chromosomes. It was shown that the evolutionary 4AL/5AL translocation, which characterises some of the Triticeae species, is not present in the meadow fescue genome. A putative insertion of a segment orthologous to Triticeae 2 at the top of 6F, similar to the rearrangement found in the wheat B and the rye R genome, was also observed. In addition, chromosome 4F is completely orthologous to rice chromosome 3 in contrast to the Triticeae where this rice chromosome is distributed over homoeologous group 4 and 5 chromosomes. The meadow fescue genome thus has a more ancestral configuration than any of the Triticeae genomes. The extended meadow fescue map reported here provides the opportunity for beneficial cross-species transfer of genetic knowledge, particularly from the complete genome sequence of rice."

Volume: 17 Issue: 8 Dec 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14694917/,"Fatigue is a major complaint among advanced cancer patients. Several instruments are available for measuring fatigue. The EORTC QLQ-C30 is one of the most frequently used health-related quality of life (HRQOL) instruments, and it includes a three-item fatigue subscale. Limited knowledge exists about the validity, performance and sensitivity of EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale as compared with a fatigue-specific instrument. The aim of the present study was to validate the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale (FA) against the Fatigue Questionnaire (FQ). The FQ is frequently used and was developed to measure fatigue in both cancer and noncancer populations. The FQ measures physical (PF, seven items) and mental fatigue (MF, four items). The study population included two different cohorts: A) patients with advanced metastatic cancer included in a prospective randomized study of palliative radiotherapy (n = 238); B) patients with leukaemia and malignant lymphoma curatively treated with stem-cell transplantation and high-dose chemotherapy (n = 128). The analysis demonstrated that the FA correlated higher with the PF scale (r = 0.67-0.75) as compared with the MF scale (r = 0.49-0.61). The item scale correlations between FA items and the PF scale were consistently higher than between FA items and the MF scale. A factor analysis including all the items within the FA and the FQ identified two factors. All FA items loaded on a PF factor (0.70-0.85). A floor/ ceiling effect, indicating a high number of respondents with lowest, respectively, highest scores was observed more frequently in the FA as compared with the FQ. The PF discriminated better between diagnostic groups with different levels of fatigue than the FA did. In conclusion, the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale is measuring physical fatigue. A floor/ ceiling effect seems to appear for the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale. The validity of the EORTC QLQ-C30 fatigue scale is to be questioned for use in palliative care patients. In studies with fatigue as a defined end point, a domain-specific instrument should, therefore, be added."

Ethical challenges exist, however; the most difficult were associated with the end-of-life patients, no longer responsive to standard therapy, who eagerly volunteer for cutting-edge drug trials in the hope of gaining therapeutic benefit. Many nurses lacked systematic strategies for addressing such challenges but found support from their nursing colleagues and relied on the research protocols to guide them."

Volume: 45 Issue: 8 04 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28177156/,"Despite the widespread use of current-source density (CSD) analysis of extracellular potential recordings in the brain, the physical mechanisms responsible for the generation of the signal are still debated. While the extracellular potential is thought to be exclusively generated by the transmembrane currents, recent studies suggest that extracellular diffusive, advective and displacement currents-traditionally neglected-may also contribute considerably toward extracellular potential recordings. Here, we first justify the application of the electro-quasistatic approximation of Maxwell's equations to describe the electromagnetic field of physiological origin. Subsequently, we perform spatial averaging of currents in neural tissue to arrive at the notion of the CSD and derive an equation relating it to the extracellular potential. We show that, in general, the extracellular potential is determined by the CSD of membrane currents as well as the gradients of the putative extracellular diffusion current. The diffusion current can contribute significantly to the extracellular potential at frequencies less than a few Hertz; in which case it must be subtracted to obtain correct CSD estimates. We also show that the advective and displacement currents in the extracellular space are negligible for physiological frequencies while, within cellular membrane, displacement current contributes toward the CSD as a capacitive current. Taken together, these findings elucidate the relationship between electric currents and the extracellular potential in brain tissue and form the necessary foundation for the analysis of extracellular recordings."

54,A burning question: what are the risks and benefits of mammalian torpor during and after fires?,30323932,Conservation physiology. Volume: 6 Issue: 1 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30323932/,"Although wildfires are increasing globally, available information on how mammals respond behaviourally and physiologically to fires is scant. Despite a large number of ecological studies, often examining animal diversity and abundance before and after fires, the reasons as to why some species perform better than others remain obscure. We examine how especially small mammals, which generally have high rates of energy expenditure and food requirements, deal with fires and post-fire conditions. We evaluate whether mammalian torpor, characterised by substantial reductions in body temperature, metabolic rate and water loss, plays a functional role in survival of mammals impacted by fires. Importantly, torpor permits small mammals to reduce their activity and foraging, and to survive on limited food. Torpid small mammals (marsupials and bats) can respond to smoke and arouse from torpor, which provides them with the possibility to evade direct exposure to fire, although their response is often slowed when ambient temperature is low. Post-fire conditions increase expression of torpor with a concomitant decrease in activity for free-ranging echidnas and small forest-dwelling marsupials, in response to reduced cover and reduced availability of terrestrial insects. Presence of charcoal and ash increases torpor use by captive small marsupials beyond food restriction alone, likely in anticipation of detrimental post-fire conditions. Interestingly, although volant bats use torpor on every day after fires, they respond by decreasing torpor duration, and increasing activity, perhaps because of the decrease in clutter and increase in foraging opportunities due to an increase in aerial insects. Our summary shows that torpor is an important tool for post-fire survival and, although the physiological and behavioural responses of small mammals to fire are complex, they seem to reflect energetic requirements and mode of foraging. We make recommendations on the conditions during management burns that are least likely to impact heterothermic mammals."

Patients with nephrosclerosis, diabetic nephropathy and amyloidosis were selected as high mortality risk groups (HRG). Overall and cardiovascular mortality beyond 100 d in the low-risk group (n = 372) was 14% and 3.5%, and in the HRG (n = 99) 31% and 16%, respectively. The effects of CMV infection and disease, recipient age and gender, panel-reactive cytotoxic antibodies, acute rejection, HRG, and graft loss in the whole study period were tested on overall mortality beyond 100 d in multiple analysis. HRG was independently associated with overall mortality, RR = 2.03, and still both CMV infection and disease were significant risk factors for mortality, independent of HRG. The same analysis was repeated for HRG (n = 99). Even in this small group CMV disease was independently associated with overall mortality. These data indicate that CMV increase mortality independently both in patients with otherwise high- or low-risk for long-term mortality."

A cross section of 68.1±1.4  mb is measured in the fiducial region ξ=M_{X}^{2}/s>10^{-6}, where M_{X} is the larger invariant mass of the two hadronic systems separated by the largest rapidity gap in the event. In this ξ range the scintillators are highly efficient. For diffractive events this corresponds to cases where at least one proton dissociates to a system with M_{X}>13  GeV. The measured cross section is compared with a range of theoretical predictions. When extrapolated to the full phase space, a cross section of 78.1±2.9  mb is measured, consistent with the inelastic cross section increasing with center-of-mass energy."

Volume: 51 Jun 01 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28149376/,"The aim of the present study was to identify different cluster groups of handball players according to their physical performance level assessed in a series of physical assessments, which could then be used to design a training program based on individual strengths and weaknesses, and to determine which of these variables best identified elite performance in a group of under-19 [U19] national level handball players. Players of the U19 National Handball team (n=16) performed a set of tests to determine: 10 m (ST10) and 20 m (ST20) sprint time, ball release velocity (BRv), countermovement jump (CMJ) height and squat jump (SJ) height. All players also performed an incremental-load bench press test to determine the 1 repetition maximum (1RMest), the load corresponding to maximum mean power (LoadMP), the mean propulsive phase power at LoadMP (PMPPMP) and the peak power at LoadMP (PPEAKMP). Cluster analyses of the test results generated four groupings of players. The variables best able to discriminate physical performance were BRv, ST20, 1RMest, PPEAKMP and PMPPMP. These variables could help coaches identify talent or monitor the physical performance of athletes in their team. Each cluster of players has a particular weakness related to physical performance and therefore, the cluster results can be applied to a specific training programmed based on individual needs."

Volume: 23 Issue: 3 06 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21878460/,"The Cochran-Armitage (CA) test is commonly used in both epidemiology and genetics to test for linear trend in two-way tables with a binary outcome. There has been increasing interest in the power and size of the test and in determination of sample size, especially when there is potential misclassification in the 'exposure' category. This article provides a unified approach to determination of the power function over different sampling strategies (fixed overall sample size or fixed marginal sample sizes) and allowing for misclassification in one or both variables. The misclassification may be either differential or non-differential. In addition to the standard CA test, results are also given which provide some insight into the performance of the modified CA test, which utilizes a standard error obtained without invoking the null hypothesis. Even without misclassification, some new expressions are also obtained for determining power with a fixed overall sample size. Numerical illustrations are presented with an emphasis on the more commonly occurring problem of misclassification in the exposure category."

These viruses are known to be responsible for different diseases in both wild and domestic animals. Reindeer are a keystone in the indigenous Saami culture and previous studies have reported the presence of antibodies against alphaherpesviruses in semi-domesticated reindeer in northern Norway. Mortality rates, especially in calves, can be very high in some herds and the abortion potential of alphaherpesvirus in reindeer, unlike in bovines, remains unknown. ELISA kits are the most used screening method in domestic ruminants and given the close genetic relationship between viruses within this genus, it might be possible to use such kits to screen cervids for different alphaherpesviruses. We have compared three different commercial ELISA kits in order to validate its use for reindeer and CvHV-2."

The important role played especially by the C-terminal part of the peptides is confirmed. We provide a map of the subsites of PR3 and a description of the interaction scheme for six ligands. The main difference between HNE and PR3 concerns S2, S1', S2', and S3'. The recognition subsites in PR3 are interconnected; in particular, Lys99 participates to a hydrophobic (S4) and a polar (S2) pocket. On the basis of the simulations, we suggest that VADVKDR is a highly specific sequence for PR3; enzymatic assays confirm that it is cleaved by PR3 with a high specificity constant (k(cat)/K(m) = 3,400,000 M(-1) s(-1)) and not by HNE."

Intermolecular interactions provide folding upon binding as a part of function in the viral case, while they secure and stabilize specific native interfaces as a prerequisite for function in hyperthermostable complexes. We propose a generalized concept of protein stability and interactions, which includes intermolecular interactions comprising distinct combinations of stabilizing forces depending on the types of interacting partners."

Volume: 2 Issue: 3 Jul 01 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23991365/,"Most tumors are typified by a chronic, unresolved inflammatory response that potentiates angiogenesis and therefore enables tumor progression. We have determined that dysfunctional tumor-associated adipocytes contribute to tumor-associated inflammation. In three tumor models, tumor-associated adipose tissue was characterized by thin and fragile adipocyte membranes, necrosis, robust expression of the pro-inflammatory factor HMGB1, and loss of the lipid storage mediator, perilipin-1. By transmission electron microscopy, macrophages in tumor-associated adipose tissue contained lipid droplets and resembled foam cells, which are commonly observed in inflamed tissues. In vitro co-culture studies showed that tumor-associated adipose tissue conditioned-medium stimulated monocyte-to-macrophage differentiation, adhesion, spreading, and lipid uptake. Compared with normal adipose tissue, tumor-associated adipose tissue secreted 3-fold higher levels of IL-6 and IL-6 was sufficient to stimulate macrophage differentiation and adhesion. These results suggest that, in tumors, loss of adipocyte specification, necrosis, and scavenging of adipocyte debris directly activates macrophages and contributes to tumor-associated inflammation. Thus, adipocyte dysfunction may facilitate tumor progression, especially in tumors closely aligned with adipose tissue, in particular, breast cancer. "

The hazard ratios and their corresponding 95% confidence intervals were estimated using Cox proportional hazards regression. Stratified analysis on menopausal status and smoking status was performed. Alcohol, meat, fish and fruit and vegetable consumption are suspected to have an influence on different cancers; thus we decided to perform stratified analysis on high versus low consumption of the above-mentioned variables as well. We found no overall relationship between cancers and the six different dietary patterns in this study. When stratifying on alcohol consumption, fruit and vegetable consumption and fatty fish consumption, there was a statistically higher risk of total cancer and breast cancer with high alcohol consumption, and a significantly higher risk of breast cancer with low consumption of fruit and vegetables or with low consumption of fatty fish in the western group only. A significantly higher risk of total cancer with low intake of fatty fish in the alcohol group was also observed."

Also, 57 fresh frozen endometrial carcinomas were studied for the relationship between BMI-1 protein expression, BMI-1 mRNA level, and activation of an 11-gene signature reported to represent a BMI-1-driven pathway. BMI-1 protein expression was significantly weaker in tumours with vascular invasion (P<0.0001), deep myometrial infiltration (P=0.004), and loss of oestrogen receptor (ER) (P<0.0001) and progesterone receptors (PR) (P=0.03). Low BMI-1 protein expression was highly associated with low BMI-1 mRNA expression (P=0.002), and similarly low BMI-1 mRNA expression correlated significantly with vascular invasion, ER and PR loss, and histologic grade 3. In contrast, activation of the reported 11-gene signature, supposed to represent a BMI-1-driven pathway, correlated with low mRNA expression of BMI-1 (P<0.001), hormone receptor loss, presence of vascular invasion, and poor prognosis. We conclude that BMI-1 protein and mRNA expression are significantly correlated and that BMI-1 expression is inversely associated with activation of the 11-gene signature. Loss of BMI-1 seems to be associated with an aggressive phenotype in endometrial carcinomas."

The second malignant neoplasms (SMN) included brain tumors, basal cell carcinomas, thyroid cancer, leiomyosarcoma and finally rhabdomyosarcoma in a patient who also had suffered from Hodgkin's disease while still on antileukemic treatment. Cranial radiation had been given to 58.4% of the patients in the study group, which consisted of 895 ALL patients who had completed various chemotherapy protocols. With one exception, the SMN appeared after 7.5-16.5 years at a location previously exposed to radiotherapy (RT). The estimated cumulative risk of SMN appearing within 20 years after diagnosis was 2.9%, and the corresponding risk for cases with RT was 8.1% compared to 0.3% for those without (p = 0.05). In a Cox regression analysis, the incidence rate ratio of SMN between patients with and without RT was 6.7 (95% CI = 0.8, 57.7). Based on age-, year- and sex-specific cancer incidence figures for Norway, the overall standardized incidence rate ratio (SIR) of SMN after treatment for ALL was 5.9 (95% CI = 2.2, 12.9). The number of brain tumors among patients who had received cranial radiation was nearly 27 times greater than expected, whereas no such tumors were seen after chemotherapy. Individuals treated for childhood ALL are at increased risk of a new malignancy, and this seems mainly to be associated with previous irradiation."

Volume: 470-471 Feb 01 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24140695/,"Vertebrates cannot synthetize carotenoids de novo but have to acquire them through their diet. In birds, carotenoids are responsible for the yellow to red colouration of many secondary sexual traits. They are also involved in physiological functions such as immunostimulation and immunoregulation. Consequently, carotenoid-based colouration is very often considered as a reliable signal for health and foraging abilities. Although a few studies have suggested that carotenoid-based coloured traits could be sensitive to environmental pollution such as persistent organic pollutants (POPs) contamination, the relationships between pollutants and colouration remain unclear. Here, we examined the relationships between the colouration of carotenoid-based integuments and individual POP levels in pre-laying female black-legged kittiwakes from very high latitudes. In this area, these arctic seabirds are exposed to high POPs contamination. Additionally, we investigated the relationships between colouration and body condition, a frequently used index of individual quality. We found a negative relationship between POP levels and several components of integument colouration: saturation of eye-ring, gapes and tongue, suggesting that POPs could disrupt colouration of labile integuments in female kittiwakes. In addition, we found that females in better body condition displayed more orange and brighter gapes and tongue than females in poor body condition. These results demonstrate that hue and brightness are sensitive to the current health and nutritional status of female kittiwakes. Overall, our study shows that carotenoid-based colour integuments can be affected by several environmental-driven variables. "

Sections from 82 breast carcinomas (53 effusions and 29 solid tumors) and 57 Müllerian carcinoma effusions were stained for Netrin-4 using immunohistochemistry. Immunoreactivity was scored in carcinoma cells and analyzed for association with clinicopathologic parameters, including survival. In breast carcinoma, expression of Netrin-4 was detected in carcinoma cells in 30/53 (57%) effusions compared to 3/29 (10%) solid tumors (P < 0.001). Netrin-4 was further expressed in 31/57 (54%) Müllerian carcinoma effusions. No association was found between Netrin-4 expression in breast or Müllerian carcinoma effusions and clinicopathologic parameters, including survival. Our data provide validation on protein level of upregulated Netrin-4 expression in breast carcinoma effusions. The frequent expression of Netrin-4 in Müllerian carcinoma effusions suggests a biological role for this molecule in metastases from gynecological malignancies. Netrin-4 expression in effusions does not appear to be a predictor of disease outcome."

Volume: 9 Issue: 1 Jan 2019,2019,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30680124/,"The extent to which no-take marine reserves can benefit anadromous species requires examination. Here, we used acoustic telemetry to investigate the spatial behavior of anadromous brown trout (sea trout, Salmo trutta) in relation to a small marine reserve (~1.5 km2) located inside a fjord on the Norwegian Skagerrak coast. On average, sea trout spent 42.3 % (±5.0% SE) of their time in the fjord within the reserve, a proportion similar to the area of the reserve relative to that of the fjord. On average, sea trout tagged inside the reserve received the most protection, although the level of protection decreased marginally with increasing home range size. Furthermore, individuals tagged outside the reserve received more protection with increasing home range size, potentially opposing selection toward smaller home range sizes inflicted on fish residing within reserves, or through selective fishing methods like angling. Monthly sea trout home ranges in the marine environment were on average smaller than the reserve, with a mean of 0.430 (±0.0265 SE) km2. Hence, the reserve is large enough to protect the full home range of some individuals residing in the reserve. Synthesis and applications: In general, the reserve protects sea trout to a varying degree depending on their individual behavior. These findings highlight evolutionary implications of spatial protection and can guide managers in the design of marine reserves and networks that preserve variation in target species' home range size and movement behavior."
85,Targeting of nucleoprotein to chemokine receptors by DNA vaccination results in increased CD8(+)-mediated cross protection against influenza.,26387432,Vaccine. Volume: 33 Issue: 49 Dec 08 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26387432/,"Vaccination is at present the most efficient way of preventing influenza infections. Currently used inactivated influenza vaccines can induce virus-neutralizing antibodies that are protective against a particular influenza strain, but hamper the induction of cross-protective T-cell responses to later infections. Thus, influenza vaccines need to be updated annually in order to confer protection against circulating influenza strains. This study aims at developing an efficient vaccine that can induce broader protection against influenza. For this purpose, we have used the highly conserved nucleoprotein (NP) from an influenza A virus subtype H7N7 strain, and inserted it into a vaccine format that targets an antigen directly to relevant antigen presenting cells (APCs). The vaccine format consists of bivalent antigenic and targeting units, linked via an Ig-based dimerization unit. In this study, NP was linked to MIP-1α, a chemokine that targets the linked antigen to chemokine receptors 1, 3 and 5 expressed on various APCs. The vaccine protein was indirectly delivered by DNA. Mice were vaccinated intradermally with plasmids, in combination with electroporation to enhance cellular uptake of DNA. We found that a single DNA vaccination was sufficient for induction of both antibody and T cell responses in BALB/c mice. Targeting of nucleoprotein to chemokine receptors enhanced T cell responses but not antibody responses. Moreover, a single dose of MIP1α-NP conferred protection in BALB/c mice against a lethal challenge with an H1N1 influenza virus. The observed cross-protection was mediated by CD8(+) T cells. "

We find correlations between scientific misbehavior and the location of undergraduate studies and whether the respondents have had science ethics lectures previously. The study provides evidence for the concurrent validity of the two instruments used to measure attitudes and behavior, i.e. the Kalichman scale and the Research Misbehavior Severity Score (RMSS). Although the direction of causality between attitudes and misbehavior cannot be determined in this study the correlation between the two indicates that it can be important to engender the right attitudes in early career researchers."

The risk of a first parity cow being treated for mastitis was almost 3 times higher at calving in Norway than in Sweden. The period with the highest risk for mastitis treatments was from 2 days before calving until 14 days after calving and the highest risk for removal was from calving to 10 days after calving in all countries. The study clearly demonstrated differences in bovine mastitis treatment patterns among the Nordic countries. The most important findings were the differences in treatment risks during different lactations within each country, as well as differences in strategies with respect to the time during lactation mastitis was treated."
90,Antiphospholipid Antibodies are Associated with Low Levels of Complement C3 and C4 in Patients with Systemic Lupus Erythematosus.,27135178,Scandinavian journal of immunology. Volume: 84 Issue: 2 Aug 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27135178/,"Complement activation and low complement levels are common in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE). Antiphospholipid antibodies (aPL) are found in about 30-40% of patients with SLE. This study aimed to investigate the association between aPL and complement levels in patients with SLE. Serum samples were collected from 269 patients with SLE enrolled in the Norwegian Systemic Connective Tissue and Vasculitis Registry (NOSVAR) during 2003-2009, and from 353 controls. All samples were analysed for anti-β2 glycoprotein 1 (anti-β2GP1) and anticardiolipin antibodies (aCL), C-reactive protein (CRP) and complement components C3 and C4. Median CRP level was significantly higher in cases than in controls (2.06 versus 0.90 mg/l; P < 0.0001). No significant difference in CRP was found between SLE patients with or without aPL (2.09 versus 1.89; P = 0.665). Median C3 levels were similar in cases (1.03 g/l) and controls (1.00 g/l), whereas median C4 levels were 0.16 g/l in cases versus. 0.19 in controls (P < 0.0001). However, aPL-positive SLE patients had significantly lower median C3 levels (0.92 versus. 1.07 g/l; P = 0.001) and C4 levels (0.11 versus 0.16 g/l; P < 0.0001) compared to aPL-negative patients. Lower C3 and C4 values in aPL-positive SLE patients may reflect a higher consumption of C3 and C4 due to more pronounced complement activation in aPL-positive SLE patients compared to SLE patients without aPL.

Volume: 18 Issue: 2 Feb 09 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28208755/,"Our understanding of the post-transcriptional mechanisms involved in follicular atresia is limited; however, an important development has been made in understanding the biological regulatory networks responsible for mediating follicular atresia. MicroRNAs have come to be seen as a key regulatory actor in determining cell fate in a wide range of tissues in normal and pathological processes. Profiling studies of miRNAs during follicular atresia and development have identified several putative miRNAs enriched in apoptosis signaling pathways. Subsequent in vitro and/or in vivo studies of granulosa cells have elucidated the functional role of some miRNAs along with their molecular pathways. In particular, the regulatory roles of some miRNAs have been consistently observed during studies of follicular cellular apoptosis. Continued work should gradually lead to better understanding of the role of miRNAs in this field. Ultimately, we expect this understanding will have substantial benefits for fertility management at both the in vivo or/and in vitro levels. The stable nature of miRNA holds remarkable promise in clinical use as a diagnostic tool and in reproductive medicine to solve the ever-increasing fertility problem. In this review, we summarize current knowledge of the involvement of miRNAs in follicular atresia, discuss the challenges for further work and pinpoint areas for future research."
92,Recent increase in incidence of cervical precancerous lesions in Norway: nationwide study from 1992 to 2016.,30734284,International journal of cancer. Feb 08 2019,2019,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30734284/,"We analysed patterns in the incidence of cervical intraepithelial neoplasia grades 2 and 3 (CIN2, CIN3) and adenocarcinoma in situ (AIS) by age and histology in 1992-2016 in Norway and described changes in screening tests. Incident cases of CIN2, CIN3, AIS, and cervical cancer were identified in the Cancer Registry of Norway, as were all women with at least one screening test. The annual percentage change statistic was used to assess point estimates and changes in age-specific and age-standardised incidence rates (IR). Women aged 25-29 years had the highest incidence of cervical precancerous lesions (CIN2: 192.9/105 , CIN3: 737.2/105 , AIS: 32.5/105 in 2016). The IR of CIN2 increased for all screening ages (25-69 years) from 3.6% to 6.7% per year. CIN3 incidence increased by 1.6% (95% confidence interval [CI] 0.6-2.6) annually. A steep increase in AIS incidence was observed in all age groups (7.1% per year, 95% CI 5.3-8.8). Changes in screening tests and the histological verification of cervical precancerous lesions alone cannot explain the steady increase in incidence we observed over the 25-year study period, and increased exposure to human papillomavirus (HPV) likely plays a role. Age-appropriate treatment of screening-detected cervical precancerous lesions is needed for effective cervical cancer control while avoiding overtreatment and related health risks. In order to perform an appropriate harm-benefit evaluation of cervical cancer control efforts, detailed information on screening technology and background risks, including HPV vaccination status, is needed to create optimal public health policy.

Volume: 207 Issue: Pt 23 Nov 2004,2004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15498952/,"Growing animals may exhibit developmental plasticity as an adaptation to variability in the environmental conditions during development. We examined physiological and morphological responses to short-term food shortage of 12-16-day-old European shag nestlings kept under laboratory conditions. After 4 days on a weight maintenance diet, the resting metabolic rate (RMR) of diet-restricted nestlings was 36.5% lower compared with control fed nestlings, after controlling for body mass. This response was accompanied by a reduction in body temperature (T(b)) and by reductions in the size of several visceral organs, muscles and lipid stores, while the overall structural growth was maintained almost in line with the age-specific growth rate of controls. Hence, the pattern of energy allocation reflected a very high priority to structural growth at the expense of visceral organs, lipid deposits and muscles. The reduced T(b) and size of the liver served as important physiological processes behind the observed reductions in RMR. We discuss the possible adaptive significance of this differential developmental plasticity during temporal food shortage. This is the first study of avian developmental plasticity to report substantial energy saving in combination with a high structural growth rate."

Volume: 155 02 23 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28087451/,"The avian eggshell membrane (ESM) is stabilized by extensive cross-linkages, making the identification of its protein constituents technically challenging. Herein, we applied various extraction/solubilization conditions followed by proteomic analysis to characterize the protein constituents of ESM derived from the unfertilized chicken eggs. The egg white and eggshell proteomes (including previous published work) were determined and compared to ESM to identify proteins that are relatively or highly specific to ESM. Merging the results from different extraction/solubilization conditions with various proteomes allowed the identification of 472, 225, and 488 proteins in the ESM, egg white, and eggshell proteomes, respectively. Of these, 163 and 124 proteins were relatively or highly specific to ESM, respectively. GO term analysis of the common proteins and ESM unique proteins generated 8 and 9 significantly enriched functional groups, respectively. Different families of proteins that were identified as ESM-specific included collagens, CREMPs, histones, AvBDs, lysyl oxidase-like 2 (LOXL2), and ovocalyxin-36 (OCX36). These proteins serve as a foundation for the mechanically stable ESM that rests upon the egg white compartment and is a physical barrier against pathogen invasion. Overall, our results highlight the structural nature of the ESM constituents that are relevant to various biomedical applications, such as wound healing."

Volume: 524 Issue: 18 12 15 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27126450/,"This study refines the characterization of the rat parietal cortical domain in terms of cyto- and chemoarchitecture as well as thalamic connectivity. We recognize three subdivisions of the posterior parietal cortex (PPC), which are architectonically distinct from the neighboring somatosensory and visual cortices. Furthermore, we show that the different parietal areas are differently connected with thalamic nuclei. The medial portion of PPC (mPPC) is connected primarily with the medial portion of the lateral posterior nucleus (LP), whereas the lateral portion (lPPC) connects with the posterior complex (Po). The more caudolateral part of PPC (PtP) also projects to Po but can be distinguished from lPPC based on architectonic criteria. The primary somatic and visual cortices, neighboring PPC, are preferentially connected with the primary ventral posterior and dorsolateral geniculate nuclei, respectively, and less with the associational Po and LP. Particularly the border between the secondary visual cortex and the PPC has been a matter of controversy, but here we show that, although PPC subareas are connected with Po and medial LP, the medial and lateral secondary visual cortices are connected with lateral LP and a portion of medial LP different from that connected with PPC. The resulting delineations and specifications of connectivity with thalamic nuclei together with upcoming studies of cortical connectivity will facilitate detailed studies on the role of the subdivisions of PPC in the rat as diverse, higher order associative cortical areas, comparable to those described in the primate.for J.

The human gene encodes a single 2.4-kb mRNA with a restricted and developmentally-regulated tissue distribution pattern. In the fetus, ephrin-A2 mRNA is expressed in brain and intestine, whereas in the adult, high levels of ephrin-A2 mRNA are detectable in lung and intestine. Using PCR-based screening of genomic DNA from human x rodent hybrid cell lines, the gene encoding ephrin-A2 (EFNA2) was assigned to chromosome 19. Fluorescence in situ hybridization to metaphase chromosome preparations refined this localization to band p13.3."

Volume: 15 Issue: 6 May 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16629810/,"Genetic diversity and fine-scale population structure in the lichen-forming ascomycete Xanthoria parietina was investigated using sequence variation in part of the intergenic spacer (IGS) and the complete internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. Sampling included 213 and 225 individuals, respectively, from seven populations in two different habitats, bark and rock, on the island Storfosna off the central west coast of Norway. Both markers revealed significant variation and a total of 10 IGS and 16 ITS haplotypes were found. There were no signs of significant positive spatial autocorrelation at any spatial size class down to 10% of transect length, nor did we find significant deviations from neutrality or signs of historical population expansion. Analysis of molecular variance (amova) indicated that most of the genetic variance observed was within populations, but when populations were grouped according to habitat, more than a quarter of the variance was explained among groups. Pairwise comparisons of populations (F(ST), exact tests of population differentiation) revealed significant differentiation between populations in different habitats (on bark or rock), but not between populations in the same habitat. Haplotype networks show that internal and presumably old haplotypes are shared between habitats, whereas terminal haplotypes tend to be unique to a habitat, mostly bark. We interpret the observed pattern to mean that there is no evidence of restricted gene flow between populations in the same habitat at the present spatial scale (interpopulation distances one or a few kilometres). On the other hand, differentiation between habitats is considerable, which we attribute to restricted gene flow between habitats (habitat isolation). Evidence suggests that the observed differentiation did not evolve locally. Estimates of divergence time between populations in the respective habitats indicate that an ancestral population started to diverge at least 34,000 years ago but probably much further back in time."

Molecular basis of disease. Volume: 1864 Issue: 3 Mar 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29246447/,"Activated factor (F) VII is a vitamin K-dependent glycoprotein that initiates blood coagulation upon interaction with tissue factor. FVII deficiency is the most common of the rare congenital bleeding disorders. While the mutational pattern has been extensively characterized, the pathogenic molecular mechanisms of mutations, particularly at the intracellular level, have been poorly defined. Here, we aimed at elucidating the mechanisms underlying altered FVII biosynthesis in the presence of three mutation types in the catalytic domain: a missense change, a microdeletion and a frameshift/elongation, associated with severe or moderate to severe phenotypes. Using CHO-K1 cells transiently transfected with expression vectors containing the wild-type FVII cDNA (FVIIwt) or harboring the p.I289del, p.G420V or p.A354V-p.P464Hfs mutations, we found that the secretion of the FVII mutants was severely decreased compared to FVIIwt. The synthesis rate of the mutants was slower than the FVIIwt and delayed, and no degradation of the FVII mutants by proteasomes, lysosomes or cysteine proteases was observed. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy studies showed that FVII variants were localized into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) but were not detectable within the Golgi apparatus. These findings suggested that a common pathogenic mechanism, possibly a defective folding of the mutant proteins, was triggered by the FVII mutations. The misfolded state led to impaired trafficking of these proteins causing ER retention, which would explain the low to very low FVII plasma levels observed in patients carrying these mutations."

Chronic stimulation was applied anally or vaginally by an integrated plug electrode for a median of 5.4 months. After therapy, 68% of the patients were continent or had improved so such that the planned operation was cancelled. At 2-year follow-up, the persisting success rate after electrostimulation was reduced to 56%, 31% had undergone surgical repair or were awaiting colposuspension, 9% were still incontinent, but refused surgery, and 4% were deceased. However, in the high-compliance group of 45 patients who had used the device regularly for at least 3 months, the success rate of pelvic floor stimulation was 72% at 2-year follow-up. The therapeutic effect could be verified objectively by positive changes in clinical stress test and dynamic urethral pressure profile. Approximately 2,300 pounds were saved for each patient avoiding surgery. A 40% reduction of the total cost of stress incontinence therapy was attained by the presented model."

Fish is a mainstay of Norwegian diets ensuring high familiarity and divergent preferences between persons and among household members. Structural equation modelling was used to test how different individual and social variables influence two different assessments of perceived influence: absolute and relative influence. The findings showed that adolescents' motivation (involvement and reward), family communication patterns, social norms and parent preferences affect adolescents' participation in family decisions concerning fish as a main meal. Helping behaviour had no significant effect on perceived influence. Most of the results (12 of 14 relationships) are consistent with respect to both absolute and relative measures of perceived influence in family meal decisions."

Volume: 109 Issue: 3 Jul 1990",1990,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2401222/,"We studied the fiber type composition and contractile properties of mouse soleus motor units at 2 days, 5 days and 2 weeks of age. We used Lucifer Yellow injection to mark muscle fibers belonging to the same motor unit in the two youngest age groups, and the traditional method of glycogen depletion in the oldest. The age groups were chosen because 2 days is at the end of muscle fiber production; 5 days is at the start of synapse elimination in the muscle and 2 weeks is at the end. Muscle fibers were classified as fast (F) or slow (S) on the basis of their myosin heavy chain (MHC) content, as determined by different monoclonal antibodies. Motor units are already dominated by either F- or S-fibers at 2 days, suggesting an early preferential innervation of the two types of fibers. A substantial part of the remaining refinement of the innervation takes place during the next 3 days, while the total number of terminals in the muscle remains constant. This is most easily explained by an exchange of aberrant for correct synapses during this period. A smaller part of the refinement of the innervation occurs during the subsequent period of synapse elimination."

We previously described the cloning of a novel C-type lectin-like receptor, KLRH1, encoded in the NK complex adjacent to the Ly49 genes and expressed by subsets of NK and NKT cells. MHC influence on selection of KLRH1(+) NK cells in congenic strains suggested that KLRH1 may have an MHC ligand, although we were unable to identify any such ligand. In this study, we have used a sensitive reporter system and Fc fusion protein to demonstrate that KLRH1 binds specifically to the classical MHC class I molecule RT1-A2 of the RT1(n) haplotype. Cytolytic activity of KLRH1-transfected RNK-16 cells was also inhibited by target cells expressing RT1-A2(n). Thus, KLRH1 represents a novel family of MHC allele-specific inhibitory receptors expressed by NK cells."

The results showed heterogeneity of FcR expression on Langerhans' cells (LC) and keratinocytes (KC). The MoAb IV.3 against FcR II (CDw32) gave granular staining of most LC whereas the MoAb 32.2 against FcR I (CD64) occasionally stained a few dendritic cells. 32.2 demonstrated weak granular staining along the outer aspect of KC in stratum spinosum and stratum basale and intense staining of stratum corneum and stratum granulosum. The MoAbs Leu 11b against FcR III (CD16) and B1D6 reacting with a placental FcR with low affinity for IgG gave intense linear membrane staining of KC. Leu 11b produced strongest staining of stratum granulosum and B1D6 the strongest staining of stratum spinosum and basale. The results confirm our previous observations of FcR in situ on LC and KC in normal skin using functional assays and demonstrate that these EC possess different types of low affinity FcR. The data support the contention of an immune function of KC. FcR may be mediators for interaction between KC and LC. The FcR activity in stratum granulosum may have an immune function as a barrier against microorganisms and other antigens.

Design For survival analyses, ""failure"" was defined as the event of a patient reporting a Lysholm score <65 or undergoing an ipsilateral knee replacement. The Kaplan-Meier method was used for construction of a survival functions plot for the event ""failure."" Log rank (Mantel-Cox) test was used for comparison of survival distributions in the 2 groups. Results The long-term failure rate (62% overall) was significantly higher in the MFX group (66%) compared with the OAT group (51%, P = 0.01). Furthermore, the mean time to failure was significantly shorter ( P < 0.001) in the MFX group, 4.0 years (SD 4.1) compared with the OAT group, 8.4 years (SD 4.8). In the OAT group, the survival rate stayed higher than 80% for the first 7 years, and higher than 60% for 15 years, while the survival rate dropped to less than 80% within 12 months, and to less than 60% within 3 years in the MFX group, log rank (Mantel-Cox) 20.295 ( P < 0.001). The same pattern was found in a subgroup of patients ( n = 134) of same age (<51 years) and size of treated lesion (<500 mm2), log rank (Mantel-Cox) 10.738 ( P = 0.001). The nonfailures (48%) were followed for median 15 yeas (1-18 years). Conclusions MFX articular cartilage repairs failed more often and earlier than the OAT repairs, both in the whole cohort and in a subgroup of patients matched for age and size of treated lesion, indicating that the OAT repair is the more durable.

The present study aimed to evaluate the effect of photo-irradiated CA against Streptococcus mutans (cariogenic bacteria) biofilm as it relates to hydroxyl radical formation. S. mutans biofilms grown on hydroxyapatite disks were immersed in CA solution (0-2 mg/mL) and irradiated with LED light at wavelengths of 365, 385, and 400 nm and at irradiances of 500, 1000, and 2000 mW/cm2 for 4 min. Biofilm viable bacterial counts were determined by colony counting. The yield of hydroxyl radicals generated by the LED irradiation of CA solution was quantified by electron spin resonance analysis. Of the conditions tested, the highest bactericidal effect, with a > 5-log reduction in viable bacterial counts, was obtained by irradiation of a 1 mg/mL CA solution with 385 nm LED and at an irradiance of 2000 mW/cm2. Hydroxyl radical formation was related to this bactericidal effect. The present study suggests that the antimicrobial technique based on the 385 nm LED irradiation of CA is effective against cariogenic biofilms and can be applied as an adjunctive chemotherapy for dental caries."

Patients aged 55-80 years with blood pressures 160-200/<90 mm Hg were followed for a mean of 4.7 years. Blood pressure was similarly reduced in the losartan (n=660) and atenolol (n=666) ISH groups. There were 88 (6.6%) patients who experienced a stroke, 18 of which were fatal. Of patients experiencing strokes, 72.7% had an ischemic stroke. ISH patients in LIFE compared to the non-ISH group had a higher incidence of any stroke and embolic stroke, and similar incidences of fatal, atherosclerotic, and hemorrhagic/other strokes. The incidence of any stroke (40% risk reduction [RR], p=0.02), fatal stroke (70% RR, p=0.035), and atherothrombotic stroke (45% RR, p=0.022) was significantly lower in losartan-treated compared to the atenolol-treated patients. The 36% RR for embolic strokes in the losartan group was not statistically significantly (p=0.33) different from the atenolol group. These data suggest that losartan-based treatment is more effective than an atenolol-based treatment for patients with ISH and a high risk for stroke."

Volume: 151-152,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25643862/,"The salmon louse (Lepeophtheirus salmonis spp.) is an economically important parasite on Atlantic salmon reared in aquaculture globally. Production and degradation of chitin, a major component of the exoskeleton, is the target of some pesticides (Di/Teflubenzuron) used in management of lice on farmed fish. These chemicals inhibit molting of the salmon louse leading to the death of the parasite. We found three chitinases (LsChi1, LsChi2 and LsChi4) in the salmon louse genome. Sequence analysis and phylogeny showed that they belong to the GH18 type of chitinase group and show high sequence similarity to chitinases found in other crustaceans and in insects. Expression patterns were different for all three chitinases suggesting different functions during louse development. Furthermore, the function of LsChi2 was further explored through the use of RNA interference and infection trials. Copepodids with knock down of LsChi2 transcripts were deformed and showed a highly reduced infection success."
113,Dichotic listening performance predicts language comprehension.,16644562,Laterality. Volume: 11 Issue: 3 May 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16644562/,"Dichotic listening performance is considered a reliable and valid procedure for the assessment of language lateralisation in the brain. However, the documentation of a relationship between language functions and dichotic listening performance is sparse, although it is accepted that dichotic listening measures language perception. In particular, language comprehension should show close correspondence to perception of language stimuli. In the present study, we tested samples of reading-impaired and normally achieving children between 10 and 13 years of age with tests of reading skills, language comprehension, and dichotic listening to consonant-vowel (CV) syllables. A high correlation between the language scores and the dichotic listening performance was expected. However, since the left ear score is believed to be an error when assessing language laterality, covariation was expected for the right ear scores only. In addition, directing attention to one ear input was believed to reduce the influence of random factors, and thus show a more concise estimate of left hemisphere language capacity. Thus, a stronger correlation between language comprehension skills and the dichotic listening performance when attending to the right ear was expected. The analyses yielded a positive correlation between the right ear score in DL and language comprehension, an effect that was stronger when attending to the right ear. The present results confirm the assumption that dichotic listening with CV syllables measures an aspect of language perception and language skills that is related to general language comprehension."

Volume: 27 Issue: 1 Feb 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28026106/,"Recovery is a crucial concept in the mental health field. The research of recovery is split into the categories of personal, social and clinical recovery. The purpose of this study was to explore the fragmented concept of recovery in light of assertive community treatment (ACT) in Norway. The study has a mixed methods design with a pragmatic approach. The Questionnaire about the Process of Recovery and open-ended questions posed to 70 participants from 12 ACT teams in Norway, gathered by the ""Users interview users"" method, are combined with interviews or focus groups with eight of these participants. Surprisingly those under a community treatment order (CTO) report the highest degree of personal recovery. The qualitative material shows that the service users interpreted the concept of recovery differently than researchers and professionals. The ACT service users highlighted three important elements: flexible treatment, medication and access to a car. They emphasized the necessity for basic needs to be met in order to experience a meaningful recovery process, and these basic needs may be of even greater importance to those under CTOs. Their experiences should imply a greater emphasis on securing basic needs such as secure housing, sounder finances and access to the normal benefits offered by society."

Reading speed, handwriting speed, written fluency, oral fluency, vocabulary, and years of formal education were measured in a sample of healthy volunteers (N=101) ranging in age from 20 to 88 years. Multiple regression analyses revealed that reading and handwriting speed strongly predicted verbal fluency performance. These measures, together with vocabulary skills and mental status, were significant predictors of performance on the fluency tasks. Present results suggest that decrement in verbal fluency performance in the aged may, at least partially, be due to reduced psychomotor speed rather than to decline in linguistic or cognitive functions."

Significant outcome predictors were identified by means of separate multiple regression analyses on each outcome measure at follow-up, using symptom duration, physical activity level, disability pension status, and occurrence of critical life events as independent variables, together with baseline symptom intensity and age, which were adjusted for. An adequate physical activity level and increasing age predicted a positive outcome, while receiving a permanent disability pension or having experienced an excess of major negative life events predicted a negative outcome. Symptom duration did not affect outcome."

The Cancer Registry of Norway and the Norwegian Society of Pathology have previously developed a national electronic template for histopathology reporting on colorectal carcinoma resection specimens. The present study was undertaken to investigate (1) whether quality routines in Norwegian pathology laboratories might affect completeness of such histopathology reports and (2) whether the national electronic template improves completeness of histopathology reports compared with other modes of reporting. A questionnaire on quality routines was sent to the 21 pathology laboratories in Norway. All histopathology reports on colorectal cancer submitted to the Cancer Registry for a 3-month period in the autumn of 2007 were then evaluated on the mode of reporting and the presence of 11 key parameters. Of the 20 laboratories that handled resection specimens, 16 had written guidelines on histopathology reporting. Of these, 4 used the national electronic template, 5 used checklists, 3 used locally developed electronic templates, whereas the remaining 4 had neither obligatory checklists nor templates. Of the 650 histopathology reports submitted to the Cancer Registry in the 3-month period, the national template had been used in 170 cases (26.2%), checklists/locally developed templates in 112 cases (17.2%), and free text in 368 cases (56.6%). Quality routines in the pathology laboratories clearly governed reporting practice and the completeness of the histopathology reports. Use of the national electronic template significantly improved (P < .05) the presence of the 11 key parameters compared with reporting by checklists, locally developed electronic templates, or free text."

125,Increasing levels of rapeseed expeller meal in diets for pigs: effects on protein and energy metabolism.,29804551,Animal : an international journal of animal bioscience. Volume: 13 Issue: 2 Feb 2019,2019,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29804551/,"The heavy reliance on imported soybean meal (SBM) as a protein source makes it necessary for the European pig industry to search for alternatives and to develop pigs that perform efficiently when fed such ingredients. Digestion and metabolism are major physiological processes contributing to variation in feed efficiency. Therefore, an experiment was conducted to assess the effects of replacing SBM with increasing levels of rapeseed meal (RSM) in diets for young pigs on apparent total tract digestibility (ATTD) of energy and nutrients, nitrogen (N) balance, energy metabolism and carbohydrate, protein and fat oxidation. Four diets were fed to 32 pigs (22.7±4.1 kg initial BW) for three weeks. The diets consisted of a control cereal grain-SBM basal diet and three test diets where SBM and wheat were partially replaced with 10%, 20%, and 30% of expeller RSM. Increasing level of RSM in the diets linearly reduced ATTD of organic matter, CP, total carbohydrates, dietary fiber and energy. Utilization of digested nitrogen (DN) for N retention and total N excretion were not affected by RSM inclusion, however, RSM inclusion induced a shift in N excretion from urine to feces. Despite a linear increase in liver to metabolic BW ratio, heat production and utilization of metabolizable energy (ME) for retention were not affected by increasing RSM inclusion. In conclusion, replacing SBM with up to 30% of expeller RSM in nutritionally balanced diets for young pigs reduced the ATTD of most nutrients and energy, but did not affect N and energy retention in the body or efficiency of utilization of DN or ME for retention."
126,Hyperthermia induced atrial natriuretic peptide expression and deviant heart development in Atlantic salmon Salmo salar embryos.,16466726,General and comparative endocrinology. Volume: 147 Issue: 2 Jun 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16466726/,"Heart abnormalities are increasingly recognized as a problem in salmon aquaculture. Fish in early life-stages are particularly susceptible to teratogens, including elevated water temperature. Recently, heat-induced mRNA expression of the cardiac hormone atrial natriuretic peptide (ANP), which is known to be involved in modulation of cardiac growth and regulation of cardiac homeostasis, was demonstrated in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar) embryos by RAP-PCR. The relation between heat sensitive ANP expression and heart abnormalities was explored in two experiments. In an experiment with short-term exposure, salmon eggs were heat shocked at 16 degrees C at eight different embryonic stages from gastrulation till completion of somitogenesis. The RT-PCR results showed that the ANP mRNA expression was down-regulated at the onset of heart formation at the gastrula stage, while the transcription became heat inducible from the fusioning of the heart tube around the 15th-20th somite stage and onwards. This was confirmed by whole-mount in situ hybridization, which also showed that ANP is exclusively expressed in the heart of Atlantic salmon embryos. In a second long-term experiment, salmon embryos were incubated at either 10 degrees C (high temperature) or 8 degrees C (controls) from fertilization till first feeding, and subsequently reared within normal conditions to an average size of 52 g. The long-term hyperthermic embryos showed up-regulated ANP transcription at the approximately 9th and approximately 20th somite stage and at the completion of somitogenesis. The cardiosomatic index [CSI; (ventricle weight/body weight) *100] demonstrated a significant decrease in the relative heart weight of fish incubated at 10 degrees C during the embryogenesis compared with controls. In these fish, aplasia of septum transversum was observed in 2 of 25 fish, resulting in abnormally shaped hearts situated partly within the abdominal cavity. Altogether, our results demonstrate that hyperthermia both induce deviant development of heart and associated structures and up-regulation of ANP transcription during embryogenesis. A possible role of ANP in development of heart malformations is thus suggested."
127,Efficient endosome-to-Golgi transport of Shiga toxin is dependent on dynamin and clathrin.,15126632,Journal of cell science. Volume: 117 Issue: Pt 11 May 01 2004,2004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15126632/,"It has previously been shown that Shiga toxin, despite being bound to a glycolipid receptor, can be efficiently endocytosed from clathrin-coated pits. However, clathrin-independent endocytosis is also responsible for a proportion of the toxin uptake in some cells. After endocytosis the toxin can be transported in retrograde fashion to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum, and then to the cytosol, where it exerts its toxic effect by inactivating ribosomes. In order to investigate the role of dynamin and clathrin in endosome-to-Golgi transport of Shiga toxin, we have used HeLa dyn(K44A) and BHK antisense clathrin heavy chain (CHC) cells that, in an inducible manner, express mutant dynamin or CHC antisense RNA, respectively. In these cell lines, one can study the role of dynamin and clathrin on endosome-to-Golgi transport because they, as shown here, still internalize Shiga toxin when dynamin- and clathrin-dependent endocytosis is blocked. Butyric acid has been shown to sensitize A431 cells to Shiga toxin by increasing the proportion of cell-associated toxin that is transported to the Golgi apparatus and the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we find that, in HeLa and BHK cells also, butyric acid also increased toxin transport to the Golgi apparatus and sensitized the cells to Shiga toxin. We have therefore studied the role of dynamin and clathrin in both untreated and butyric-acid-treated cells by measuring the sulfation of a modified Shiga B fragment. Our results indicate that endosome-to-Golgi transport of Shiga toxin is dependent on functional dynamin in both untreated cells and in cells treated with butyric acid. Interestingly, the regulation of Shiga toxin transport in untreated and butyric-acid-treated cells differs when it comes to the role of clathrin, because only cells that are sensitized to Shiga toxin with butyric acid need functional clathrin for endosome-to-Golgi transport."

This article describes long-term outcomes, including gingival and periodontal conditions, and the patients' attitudes about treatment and outcome. The material comprised all accessible patients in the files of the Department of Orthodontics, University of Oslo, Norway, on whom treatment had been performed at least 17 years ago (n = 28). Established clinical criteria were used to assess tooth mobility, plaque and gingival indexes, and probing pocket depth. Standardized radiography was used to evaluate the presence of pathology, pulp obliteration, and root length. Similar recordings were obtained from the in situ tooth contralateral to the initial position of the grafted tooth. Criteria for determining treatment success were established. All patients responded to questions about their treatment using visual analogue scales. The mean age at surgery was 11.5 years, and the mean observation period was 26.4 years (range, 17-41 years). Of the 33 teeth transplanted in the 28 patients, 3 teeth were lost after 9, 10, and 29 years, respectively. Therefore, the 30 teeth in the 25 patients we examined yielded a survival rate of 90%. The success rate was 79% because 2 transplants had ankylosed, and 2 others failed to fulfill the proposed criteria. The patients generally responded very favorably regarding their perception of the treatment. Their only hesitation was related to some discomfort during surgery. It was concluded that survival and success rates for teeth autotransplanted when the root is partly developed compare favorably in a long-term perspective with other treatment modalities for substituting missing teeth."

Volume: 13 Issue: 7 Feb 21 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21180690/,"We give an account of some recent advances in the development of ab initio methods for the calculation of molecular response properties, involving electric, magnetic, and geometric perturbations. Particular attention is given to properties in which the basis functions depend explicitly both on time and on the applied perturbations such as perturbations involving nuclear displacements or external magnetic fields when London atomic orbitals are used. We summarize a general framework based on the quasienergy for the calculation of arbitrary-order molecular properties using the elements of the density matrix in the atomic-orbital basis as the basic variables. We demonstrate that the necessary perturbed density matrices of arbitrary order can be determined from a set of linear equations that have the same formal structure as the set of linear equations encountered when determining the linear response equations (or time-dependent self-consistent-field equations). Additional components needed to calculate properties involving perturbation-dependent basis sets are flexible one- and two-electron integral techniques for geometric or magnetic-field differentiated integrals; in Kohn-Sham density-functional theory (KS-DFT), we also need to calculate derivatives of the exchange-correlation functional. We describe a recent proposal for evaluating these contributions based on automatic differentiation. Within this framework, it is now possible to calculate any molecular property for an arbitrary self-consistent-field reference state, including two- and four-component relativistic self-consistent-field wave functions. Examples of calculations that can be performed with this formulation are presented."

Fish infected by Gyrodactylus derjavini, G. macronychus and Anodonta anatina glochidia, and free living Argulus foliaceus were exposed to acidic Al-rich water (pH 5.8), acidic Al-poor water (pH 5.8) and control water (pH 6.3). The results showed that aqueous aluminium had a negative effect on the ectoparasites tested, without any apparent negative effect on the fish hosts. The effect of aluminium was dependent on the kind of organism tested. The gyrodactylids were eliminated, while the duck mussel glochidia showed a decrease in abundance when exposed to 200-260 mug Al/l at pH 5.8. The little fish louse showed increased mortality rate when exposed to aluminium. The effects of aluminium on the parasites in the present study confirm the importance of water quality in general, and acidification in particular, for the distribution and population dynamics of ectoparasites in freshwater environments."

The aim of this study was to identify signatures of differentially expressed genes in prostate cancer using DNA microarray technology, evaluating expression profiles in matched pairs of benign and malignant tissue. Samples were collected from 33 radical prostatectomies, and 52 specimens were included, representing 29 histologically verified primary tumours, 19 paired samples of malignant and benign tissue, and 4 non-paired benign tissue samples. Microarray analysis was performed using an expanded sequence verified set of 40,000 human cDNA clones, revealing several genes with significant differences between malignant and benign tissue, including recently reported genes like alpha-methylacyl-CoA racemase (AMACR) and hepsin, as well as genes relevant for tumour development and progression. Leave out cross validation (LOCV) test correctly predicted tumour or benign tissue in 47 (90.3%) out of 52 cases, significantly better than cross validation tests using randomly permuted tissue labels. Unsupervised clustering analysis revealed 3 distinct patient clusters significantly associated with Gleason score, and high grade tumours (Gleason score >/=7) accumulated in cluster 1 (C1). Gene expression profiles correctly predicted 100% of tumour samples segregating to C1, as also validated by LOCV. Gene expression profiles were analysed in filtered and floored datasets with similar results, and a pair-wise design was also tested. Gene expression profiles provided tumour clusters linked to differentiation, and revealed novel markers relevant for molecular classification, grading and therapy of prostate cancer."

Despite their perceived importance, very little is known about the natural development of and possible correlations between bifidobacteria in human populations. To address this knowledge gap, we analyzed stool samples from a randomly selected healthy cohort of 87 infants and their mothers with >90% of vaginal delivery and nearly 100% breast-feeding at 4 months. Fecal material was sampled during pregnancy, at 3 and 10 days, at 4 months, and at 1 and 2 years after birth. Stool samples were predicted to be rich in the species Bifidobacterium adolescentis, B. bifidum, B. dentium, B. breve, and B. longum. Due to high variation, we did not identify a clear age-related structure at the individual level. Within the population as a whole, however, there were clear age-related successions. Negative correlations between the B. longum group and B. adolescentis were detected in adults and in 1- and 2-year-old children, whereas negative correlations between B. longum and B. breve were characteristic for newborns and 4-month-old infants. The highly structured age-related development of and correlation networks between bifidobacterial species during the first 2 years of life mirrors their different or competing nutritional requirements, which in turn may be associated with specific biological functions in the development of healthy gut."

Whereas olfactory learning allowing memory of nutritious plants is well demonstrated, little is known about learning and memory of toxic items in adult lepidopterans. Moths may use bitter substances to detect and possibly learn to avoid noxious plants. We have studied the physiological and behavioural effects of two bitter substances, quinine and sinigrin, on the moth Heliothis virescens. Electrophysiological recordings showed responses to both compounds in gustatory receptor neurons on the antennae. The response patterns suggested a peripheral discrimination between quinine and sinigrin. We evaluated their putative aversive effect in an appetitive conditioning context where the moths learned to associate an odour with sucrose. We first aimed at enhancing olfactory conditioning of the proboscis extension response by testing the effect of the sucrose concentration on acquisition, retention and extinction. 2 mol l(-1) and 3 mol l(-1) sucrose concentration gave similar acquisition, retention and extinction performances. Experiments involving pre-exposure or facilitated extinction with an odour paired with quinine, sinigrin or no tastant showed a latent inhibitory effect, as well as an aversive effect of quinine and, to a lesser extent, of sinigrin. The results suggested that the two tastants may act as negative reinforcers in H. virescens."

Volume: 2008 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19163156/,"A novel method for determining needle position based on local tissue impedance and electrode polarization data, is presented. Measurements of electrical impedance in a small volume around a needle tip can aid in determining if the needle is in the desired tissue. There are many possible applications for this technique, such as needle positioning when administering drugs in blood vessels or muscle tissue, for epidural analgesia or needle EMG exams."
140,Nutritional modulation of DNA repair in a human intervention study.,12663512,Carcinogenesis. Volume: 24 Issue: 3 Mar 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12663512/,"DNA oxidation is a potential cause of cancer in humans. It is well-known that fruits and vegetables protect against cancer, and this may be in part because they contain antioxidants, which decrease the level of oxidation of DNA. However, there are other possible mechanisms, such as an enhancement of cellular repair of this damage. A randomized cross-over study was carried out on healthy human subjects, who were given kiwifruit as a supplement to their normal diet, for 3-week periods at different 'doses', with 2-week washout periods between doses. Endogenous oxidation of bases in lymphocyte DNA, and the resistance of the DNA to oxidation ex vivo, were assessed using single cell gel electrophoresis (the 'comet assay'). The capacity to repair DNA base oxidation was measured with an in vitro test, and levels of expression of repair-related genes OGG1 and APE1 were assessed by semi-quantitative RT-PCR. Concentrations of dietary antioxidants were measured in plasma. The antioxidant status of plasma and of lymphocytes was increased by consumption of kiwifruit. Levels of endogenous oxidation of pyrimidines and purines in DNA were markedly decreased, and DNA repair measured on a substrate containing 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine was substantially increased (without change in levels of OGG1 or APE1 mRNA). The magnitude of these effects was generally not related to the number of kiwifruits consumed per day. Kiwifruit provides a dual protection against oxidative DNA damage, enhancing antioxidant levels and stimulating DNA repair. It is probable that together these effects would decrease the risk of mutagenic changes leading to cancer."

Volume: 21 Issue: 5 May 2008",2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18246051/,"BMI-1 is a member of the Polycomb group of genes (PcGs) and is involved in embryonic gene regulation and maintenance of adult stem cells. It has been suggested that BMI-1 protein is important in cell cycle regulation, since both p16/INK4a and p14/ARF are downstream BMI-1 targets. BMI-1 has been implicated in the development and progression of several malignancies, but its role in melanocytic tumors of the skin is unknown. In the present study, using immunohistochemistry on 178 benign and malignant melanocytic lesions and two different antibodies, BMI-1 expression was reduced in melanomas compared with benign nevi. In established melanomas, loss of BMI-1 expression was associated with features of aggressive tumors, such as increased tumor cell proliferation, presence of necrosis and increased expression of both N-cadherin and beta3-integrin, indicating a more invasive and mesenchymal phenotype. Low BMI-1 expression was associated with low p14 and CDK4 but not with p16 expression. Low levels of BMI-1 expression were also significantly associated with decreased patient survival."

Volume: 8 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28875109/,"The cuticles of most springtails (Collembola) are superhydrophobic, but the mechanism has not been described in detail. Previous studies have suggested that overhanging surface structures play an important role, but such structures are not a universal trait among springtails with superhydrophobic cuticles. A novel wetting experiment with a fluorescent dye revealed the extent of wetting on exposed surface structures. Using simple wetting models to describe the composite wetting of the cuticular surface structures results in underestimating the contact angles of water. Including the three-phase line tension allows for a prediction of contact angles in the observed range. The discrepancy between the contact angle predicted by simple models and those observed is especially large in the springtail Cryptopygus clavatus which changes, seasonally, from superhydrophobic to wetting without a large change in surface structure; C. clavatus does not have overhanging surface structures. This large change in observed contact angles can be explained with a modest change of the three-phase line tension."

Eleven therapists filled in the Feeling Word Checklist 58 (FWC-58) for each patient admitted to a day treatment program. The patients completed the Circumplex of Interpersonal Problems (CIP) at admission and discharge. Outcome measures were assessed at the end of treatment. At the start of treatment, therapists reported fewer feelings of rejection and being on guard in response to patients who reported high avoidant, exploitable, overly nurturing and intrusive CIP subscale traits. At the end of the treatment, the CIP subscales of being domineering, vindictive and cold correlated with fewer positive and more negative countertransference feelings. The study revealed a strong relationship between improvement and countertransference feelings. This study confirms clinical narratives on relationships between the therapists' countertransference reactions and patients' reported interpersonal problems and outcome."

Volume: 39 Issue: 2 Jul 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20112035/,"The current experiment aimed to study whether interactions with lipid metabolism possibly might explain the relative increased liver weight obtained in fish fed sub-optimal methionine levels. A basal diet based on a blend of plant proteins which is low in methionine (1.6 g Met/16 g N) was compared to a methionine adequate diet (2.2 g Met/16 g N) prepared by adding DL-methionine (2.4 g/kg) to the basal diet in the expense of wheat grain. Fish oil was used as the lipid source. The diets were balanced in all nutrients except methionine. The diets were fed to Atlantic salmon (500 g BW) for a period of 3 months. Feed intake did not differ, rendering the intake of all nutrients except methionine equal. Fish fed the low methionine diet had an increased liver size relative to body weight, indicating fat deposition in the liver. Fish given the sub-optimal methionine diet showed about six times higher fatty acid synthase (FAS) activity as compared to the fish fed the adequate methionine diet, indicating a higher de novo lipogenesis. A significant rise in the liver 18:1 to 18:0 fatty acid ratios also supported storage of lipids over fatty acid oxidation. Indeed, methionine limitation resulted in significantly higher TAG concentrations in the liver. Sub-optimal dietary methionine also resulted in lower hepatic taurine concentrations and the total bile acids concentrations were reduced in faeces and tended to be reduced in plasma. Taken together, our data show that salmon fed sub-optimal methionine levels had increased relative liver weight and developed signs commonly described in the early stage of non-alcoholic fatty liver disease in rodent models (increased FAS activity, changed fatty acid ratios and TAG accumulation)."

Volume: 219 Issue: 1 May 10 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23454835/,"The mycotoxin alternariol (AOH), a frequent contaminant in fruit and cereal products, is known to induce DNA damage with subsequent cell cycle arrest. Here we elucidated the effects of AOH on stages of cell cycle progression using the RAW 264.7 macrophage model. AOH resulted in an accumulation of cells in the G2/M-phase (4N). Most cells exhibited a large G2 nucleus whereas numbers of true mitotic cells were reduced relative to control. Both cyclin B1 and p-cdc2 levels increased, while cyclin B1 remained in the cytoplasm; suggesting arrest in the G2/M transition point. Remarkably, after exposure to AOH for 24h, most of the cells exhibited abnormally shaped nuclei, as evidenced by partly divided nuclei, nuclear blebs, polyploidy and micronuclei (MN). AOH treatment also induced abnormal Aurora B bridges, suggesting that cytokinesis was interfered within cells undergoing karyokinesis. A minor part of the resultant G1 tetraploid (4N) cells re-entered the S-phase and progressed to 8N cells."

Volume: 177 Issue: 5 Sep 01 2006",2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16920920/,"Vitamin A is established as an important immune regulator, but the mechanisms whereby vitamin A regulates T cell biology are poorly defined. In this study, we show that an active metabolite of vitamin A, all-trans retinoic acid (RA), potently stimulates T cell proliferation by modulating IL-2-mediated signaling downstream of IL-2R and independent of the induction of IL-2. Thus, at concentrations as low as 0.1 nM, RA enhanced the division of normal human T lymphocytes that were simultaneously stimulated with anti-CD3 mAbs and saturating concentrations of IL-2. At the optimal concentration of RA (50 nM), a 3-fold increase in T cell proliferation was observed. The induced proliferation was preceded by increased phosphorylation of the retinoblastoma protein and enhanced G1- to S-phase progression. Interestingly, the promitogenic effect of RA was found to be particularly directed toward increased expression of cyclin D3 at both the mRNA and protein level. Furthermore, the stimulatory effect of RA on cyclin D3 expression as well as on cell proliferation was completely abolished in the presence of the JAK inhibitor AG-490 or blocking IL-2R alpha mAbs, and RA also enhanced cyclin D3 expression and T cell proliferation in the presence of IL-2 alone. Finally, we showed that the proliferative effect of RA was mimicked by agonists of the retinoic acid receptor (RAR) and completely inhibited by a RAR-selective antagonist. In conclusion, our results indicate that RA, via RAR, stimulates IL-2-induced signaling in a JAK-dependent manner to enhance cyclin D3 expression and thereby promote T cell proliferation."

Immunocytes containing various Ig isotypes and associated J chain in gastric mucosa, as well as IgA-degrading protease activity in Helicobacter pylori cultures, were examined. Gastric body specimens from 15 H. pylori-positive and 14 H. pylori-negative patients were studied by paired immunofluorescence for IgA, IgA1, IgA2, IgG, or IgM and concurrent cellular J chain. H. pylori isolates were incubated with IgA1 or secretory IgA and examined by immunoelectrophoresis for cleavage products. A substantial increase of Ig-producing cells occurred in chronic gastritis, particularly in the IgA1 isotype, but H. pylori was shown to possess neither IgA1-specific nor nonspecific IgA-degrading protease activity. Regardless of infection status, reduced J chain expression was observed for all immunocyte isotypes (except for IgM) in inflamed compared with normal gastric body mucosa, the median positivity for IgA1 cells being reduced to 58.7% versus 87.9% (P = 0.0002), and for IgA2 cells to 48.9% versus 87.8% (P = 0.0002). This down-regulation of the J chain suggested that a large fraction of IgA monomers is produced in gastritis."

155,Optimizing the creation of base populations for aquaculture breeding programs using phenotypic and genomic data and its consequences on genetic progress.,25505485,Frontiers in genetics. Volume: 5 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25505485/,"The success of an aquaculture breeding program critically depends on the way in which the base population of breeders is constructed since all the genetic variability for the traits included originally in the breeding goal as well as those to be included in the future is contained in the initial founders. Traditionally, base populations were created from a number of wild strains by sampling equal numbers from each strain. However, for some aquaculture species improved strains are already available and, therefore, mean phenotypic values for economically important traits can be used as a criterion to optimize the sampling when creating base populations. Also, the increasing availability of genome-wide genotype information in aquaculture species could help to refine the estimation of relationships within and between candidate strains and, thus, to optimize the percentage of individuals to be sampled from each strain. This study explores the advantages of using phenotypic and genome-wide information when constructing base populations for aquaculture breeding programs in terms of initial and subsequent trait performance and genetic diversity level. Results show that a compromise solution between diversity and performance can be found when creating base populations. Up to 6% higher levels of phenotypic performance can be achieved at the same level of global diversity in the base population by optimizing the selection of breeders instead of sampling equal numbers from each strain. The higher performance observed in the base population persisted during 10 generations of phenotypic selection applied in the subsequent breeding program. "

Unless strategies for low-temperature expression are advanced, research on psychrophilic enzymes may end up being biased toward those that can be stably produced in commonly used mesophilic host systems. Two main strategies are currently being explored for the development of low-temperature expression in bacterial hosts: (i) low-temperature adaption of existing mesophilic expression systems, and (ii) development of new psychrophilic hosts. These developments include genetic engineering of the expression cassettes to optimize the promoter/operator systems that regulate heterologous expression. In this addendum we present our efforts in the development of such low-temperature expression systems, and speculate about future advancements in the field and potential applications. "

Medication reconciliation can improve communication and reduce medication errors at transitions in care. Objective Evaluate the impact of medication reconciliation and counselling intervention delivered by a pharmacist for medical patients on clinical outcomes 30 days after discharge. Setting Sultan Qaboos University Hospital, Muscat, Oman. Methods A randomized controlled study comparing standard care with an intervention delivered by a pharmacist and comprising medication reconciliation on admission and discharge, a medication review, a bedside medication counselling, and a take-home medication list. Medication discrepancies during hospitalization were identified and reconciled. Clinical outcomes were evaluated by reviewing electronic health records and telephone interviews. Main outcome measures Rates of preventable adverse drug events as primary outcome and healthcare resource utilization as secondary outcome at 30 days post discharge. Results A total of 587 patients were recruited (56 ± 17 years, 57% female); 286 randomized to intervention; 301 in the standard care group. In intervention arm, 74 (26%) patients had at least one discrepancy on admission and 100 (35%) on discharge. Rates of preventable adverse drug events were significantly lower in intervention arm compared to standard care arm (9.1 vs. 16%, p = 0.009). No significant difference was found in healthcare resource use. Conclusion The implementation of an intervention comprising medication reconciliation and counselling by a pharmacist has significantly reduced the rate of preventable ADEs 30 days post discharge, compared to the standard care. The effect of the intervention on healthcare resource use was insignificant. Pharmacists should be included in decentralized, patient-centred roles. The findings should be interpreted in the context of the study's limitations."

Few studies have investigated this earlier. A cross section of 52 participating women enrolled into a PMTCT programme were randomly selected and interviewed, using a structured questionnaire. There were three main findings. The most important consequence of participating was the difficulty associated with the breast-feeding issue. For the women who because of a wish to prevent MTCT are employing formula feeding, this causes suspicion and prejudice amongst people in the local community. Few people influence a woman's decision to take part, as they tend to keep their HIV status to themselves. More information to the general public about HIV and PMTCT programmes will enhance acceptance to HIV, and generate an environment conducive towards participation in PMTCT programmes."

Therefore, its determination is key in the quality of the final results, and there are cases in which it is still an open issue in single particle analysis (SPA). Small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) is a well-known technique applied to structural biology. It is useful from small nanostructures up to macromolecular ensembles for its ability to obtain low resolution information of the biological sample measuring its X-ray scattering curve. These curves, together with further analysis, are able to yield information on the sizes, shapes, and structures of the analyzed particles."

We analyzed cDNA expression data from 81 tumors from two patient series, one treated with doxorubicin alone (51) and the other treated with 5-fluorouracil and mitomycin (30), and both were previously studied for correlations between TP53 status and response to therapy. We observed a low frequency of progressive disease within the luminal A subtype from both series (2 of 36 versus 13 of 45 patients; P = 0.0089) and a high frequency of progressive disease among patients with luminal B type tumors treated with doxorubicin (5 of 8 patients; P = 0.0078); however, aside from these two observations, no other consistent associations between response to chemotherapy and tumor subtype were observed. These specific associations could possibly be explained by covariance with TP53 mutation status, which also correlated with tumor subtype. Using supervised analysis, we could not uncover a gene profile that could reliably (>70% accuracy and specificity) predict response to either treatment regimen."

Volume: 4 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24478982/,"Ionizing radiation is a non-specific but highly effective way to kill malignant cells. However, tumor recurrence sustained by a minor fraction of surviving tumor cells is a commonplace phenomenon caused by the activation of both cancer cell intrinsic resistance mechanisms, and also extrinsic intermediaries of therapy resistance, represented by non-malignant cells and structural components of the tumor stroma. The improved accuracy offered by advanced radiotherapy (RT)-technology permits reduced volume of healthy tissue in the irradiated field, and has been triggering an increase in the prescription of high-dose oligo-fractionated regimens in the clinics. Given the remarkable clinical success of high-dose RT and the current therapeutic shift occurring in the field, in this review we revise the existing knowledge on the effects that different radiation regimens exert on the different compartments of the tumor microenvironment, and highlight the importance of anti-tumor immunity and other tumor cell extrinsic mechanisms influencing therapeutic responses to high-dose radiation.

171,Studies of autacoid responsiveness and endothelium dependency in human umbilical arteries.,1357738,Scandinavian journal of clinical and laboratory investigation. Volume: 52 Issue: 3 May 1992,1992,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1357738/,"The effect of serotonin, prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and PGF2 alpha on the smooth muscle tension in perfused human umbilical arteries was investigated before and after removal of the endothelium. Denudation was performed mechanically using a nylon filament loop, and the efficiency of the procedure was checked by electron microscopy. In non-denuded vessels the autacoids elicited biphasic pressure responses, all starting with a vasodilatation and followed by a strong vasoconstriction. After denudation no dilatatory responses were evoked, whereas the constrictory responses appeared to be unchanged. Pre-treatment of the vessels with methylene blue did not affect the autacoid responses. Generally the perfusion pressure decreased after the de-endothelialization, in some preparations to levels of about 50% of the initial perfusion pressure. In about one-third of the preparations exposure to methylene blue led to a definite pressure increase. The results indicate that endothelium-derived factors are involved in the autacoid responses and also in the maintenance of basic vascular tonus in the umbilical circulation."

Volume: 129 Issue: 2 Apr 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29079303/,"Chemical dispersants are well-established as oil spill response tools. Several studies have emphasized their positive effects on oil biodegradation, but recent studies have claimed that dispersants may actually inhibit the oil biodegradation process. In this study, biodegradation of oil dispersions in natural seawater at low temperature (5°C) was compared, using oil without dispersant, and oil premixed with different concentrations of Slickgone NS, a widely used oil spill dispersant in Europe. Saturates (nC10-nC36 alkanes), naphthalenes and 2- to 5-ring polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) were biotransformed at comparable rates in all dispersions, both with and without dispersant. Microbial communities differed primarily between samples with or without oil, and they were not significantly affected by increasing dispersant concentrations. Our data therefore showed that a common oil spill dispersant did not inhibit biodegradation of oil at dispersant concentrations relevant for response operations."

Volume: 51 Issue: 6 May 05 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18967936/,"The oxidation reaction kinetics of thiocyanate by excess hydrogen peroxide has been studied by using capillary electrophoresis. The paper illustrates for the first time the use of capillary electrophoresis in studying reaction kinetics and provides a non-laborious way to determine the rate law and the rate constant for the above reaction in the pH range 6-8. Standard solutions of thiocyanate were mixed with buffer solutions of different pHs (6-8) and the reactions were initiated by adding appropriate volumes of hydrogen peroxide in capillary electrophoresis vials. Each reaction mixture was sampled at regular time intervals using an automatic injection programme to follow the progress of the reaction and identify the reaction products. The peak areas, representing the products, were integrated and their concentrations were quantified using calibration plots. The concentration profiles obtained from a series of experiments at a particular pH were then used to determine the rate law and the rate constant for the reaction. Furthermore, the rate of decomposition of hypothiocyanite formed during the reaction is determined for the first time. The rate law is zero order with respect to hypothiocyanite and first order with respect to hydrogen peroxide. The results indicate that the rate law for the oxidation reaction is zero order with respect to thiocyanate and first order with respect to hydrogen peroxide. The rate constant for the reaction at 25 degrees C and at zero ionic strength is 3.6(+/-0.2)x10((-4)) min(-1)."

The study was conducted using semi-structured focus group interviews in a grounded theory approach. Overall 16 public health nurses participated into three focus groups conducted in 2008. We found that the public health nurses' most important sources of information were the National guidelines and other information issued by the National Institute of Public Health. Although they argued that research was important for being able to base practice on solid information, for their own professional development and for meeting parents' demands, they were reluctant to search for such information themselves. This was explained by beliefs about their own role, limited critical appraisal skills and perceived capacity. We conclude with that insight into how knowledge is produced and how to obtain such information is not only a necessity for good quality health care and professional development, but is also a way to address challenges such as time, overload of information and the ability to answer questions parents may have. More emphasis should be given to empowering public health nurses so they can find and critically appraise research, and this should be an integrated part of practice."

Offspring birth weight related to maternal IGF-I and IGFBP-1 measured in pregnancy was studied in 368 randomly selected women without preeclampsia who delivered a singleton liveborn child in Norway between 1992 and 1994. Maternal IGF-I concentrations were not consistently associated with birth weight, but a 1-standard deviation stronger increase in IGF-I from the first to second trimester was associated with an 82-g (95% confidence interval (CI): 11, 153) higher birth weight. IGFBP-1 concentrations were inversely associated with birth weight: Birth weight was 71 g (95% CI: 14, 128) lower per 1-standard deviation higher IGFBP-1 in the second trimester, and an increase in IGFBP-1 from the first (below median) to second (above median) trimester was associated with a 342-g (95% CI: 124, 560) lower birth weight, compared with having low IGFBP-1 (below median) in both trimesters. Conversely, low IGFBP-1 in both trimesters was associated with a 200-350-g higher birth weight compared with other combinations of IGFBP-1. In conclusion, persistently low IGFBP-1 in pregnancy is associated with relatively higher birth weight. Maternal insulin resistance may provide a link between IGFBP-1 and offspring birth weight."

This article uses a phenomenological design inspired by Heidegger's philosophy with the results of fieldwork and reflection groups with 11 nurses on an acute ward. The nurses were exposed to an accumulation of negative emotions, caused by potentially or actually harmful scenarios that were more extreme than those in other nursing contexts. They protected themselves through limit-setting approaches, which conflicted with their standards of building trusting relationships with patients. The feeling of guilt might function as an appeal for authentic practice, but a change in practice requires the use of acknowledgment approaches and the systematic debriefing of accumulated burdensome feelings."

For this purpose we employ a combination of two test sets from the literature which include small and medium-sized rigid organic molecules and a series of helicenes. CC2 calculations on molecules as large as 11-helicene became possible through a recent implementation of frequency-dependent second-order properties for CC2 which makes use of the resolution-of-the-identity approximation for the electron repulsion integrals. The results are assessed with respect to the accuracy of the absolute values of the optical rotation and the prediction of the correct sign, which is crucial for the determination of absolute configurations. The performance of CC2 is compared with that of density functional theory at the B3LYP and CAM-B3LYP levels. Furthermore we investigated the influence of the molecular geometry and the one-electron basis set and tested to which extent spin-component scaling changes the results. "

A total of 216 records were found between 1801 and 2015. They were distributed along the whole coast, except for the most north-eastern part. Nearly all years with more than five records were after 2000, with 1985 as the only exception and with a maximum of 23 records in 2014. Most, 92·4%, were from July to December. Records from before 1979 were more incidental and random and no sunfish were recorded in 54 separate years between 1879 and 2015. The northernmost record was from 70° 44' N in December 1881. No relationship between year and latitude was found. Forty-four per cent of the records were of sunfish caught in fishing gear, 27% were found stranded and 30% were observed alive at sea. A trend of a decrease in numbers of observations of living individuals and an increase in numbers of strandings as dead individuals as autumn progressed was found. Geographical differences in the three categories of observation were also found. Among the specimens whose size was recorded, most were small, <30 kg and 70 cm in total length. Only 10 were heavier than 100 kg, all these were from before 1960. Annual numbers correlated weakly with sea temperatures. This was supported by a weak negative correlation with the North Atlantic Oscillation (NAO) index, because the majority of years since 2000 had a negative NAO."
186,Sensitive and critical periods in the development of handling induced seizures in mice lacking synapsins: differences between synapsin I and synapsin II knockouts.,23570901,Experimental neurology. Volume: 247 Sep 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23570901/,"Mice lacking either synapsin I or synapsin II develop handling induced seizures from around two months of age. In mice lacking synapsin I (synapsin 1 knock-out mice, Syn1KO mice) such seizures can either consist of mild myoclonic jerks or of fully developed generalized tonic-clonic seizures, and the two seizure types are quite evenly distributed. In mice lacking synapsin II (synapsin 2 knock-out mice, Syn2KO mice) all seizures are in the form of generalized tonic-clonic seizures. Through the use of specialized animal rearing procedures whereby human-animal interaction was minimized (minimal handling procedures), this study investigated effects of handling also prior to the emergence of actual seizures. The effect of minimal handling procedures was significant in both genotypes, but most pronounced in Syn1KO mice. In this genotype, minimal handling reduced the frequency of mild seizures, and completely eliminated generalized tonic-clonic seizures when the animals were tested with regular handling at 4 1/2 months of age. Neither seizure frequency nor generalized tonic-clonic seizures could be re-established through regular handling from 4 1/2 to 8 months. This suggests that the period up to 4 1/2 months constitute a sensitive period for seizures in general, and a critical period for generalized tonic-clonic seizures in this genotype. In Syn2KO mice minimal handling did not remove generalized tonic-clonic seizures, as such seizures were present when handling was introduced at 4 1/2 months. We found an initial reduction of seizure frequency, but the seizure frequency eventually reached levels seen in mice kept under regular handling regimes. Thus, it is unlikely that the period up to 4 1/2 months is a sensitive period in the Syn2KO genotype."

Volume: 10 Issue: 1 01 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28035234/,"Climate changes in the Arctic are predicted to alter distributions of marine species. However, such changes are difficult to quantify because information on present species distribution and the genetic variation within species is lacking or poorly examined. Blue mussels, Mytilus spp., are ecosystem engineers in the coastal zone globally. To improve knowledge of distribution and genetic structure of the Mytilus edulis complex in the Arctic, we analyzed 81 SNPs in 534 Mytilus spp. individuals sampled at 13 sites to provide baseline data for distribution and genetic variation of Mytilus mussels in the European Arctic. Mytilus edulis was the most abundant species found with a clear genetic split between populations in Greenland and the Eastern Atlantic. Surprisingly, analyses revealed the presence of Mytilus trossulus in high Arctic NW Greenland (77°N) and Mytilus galloprovincialis or their hybrids in SW Greenland, Svalbard, and the Pechora Sea. Furthermore, a high degree of hybridization and introgression between species was observed. Our study highlights the importance of distinguishing between congener species, which can display local adaptation and suggests that information on dispersal routes and barriers is essential for accurate predictions of regional susceptibility to range expansions or invasions of boreal species in the Arctic."

Volume: 13 Issue: 8 Aug 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25988873/,"Cancer patients have a ~4 fold increased risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) compared with the general population and this is associated with significant morbidity and mortality. This review summarizes our current knowledge of VTE and cancer, from mouse models to clinical studies. Notably, the risk of VTE varies depending on the type and stage of cancer. For instance, pancreatic and brain cancer patients have a higher risk of VTE than breast and prostate cancer patients. Moreover, patients with metastatic disease have a higher risk than those with localized tumors. Tumor-derived procoagulant factors and growth factors may directly and indirectly enhance VTE. For example, increased levels of circulating tumor-derived, tissue factor-positive microvesicles may trigger VTE. In a mouse model of ovarian cancer, tumor-derived IL-6 and hepatic thrombopoietin have been linked to increased platelet production and thrombosis. In addition, mouse models of mammary and lung cancer showed that tumor-derived granulocyte colony-stimulating factor causes neutrophilia and activation of neutrophils. Activated neutrophils can release neutrophil extracellular traps (NETs) that enhance thrombosis. Cell-free DNA in the blood derived from cancer cells, NETs and treatment with cytotoxic drugs can activate the clotting cascade. These studies suggest that there are multiple mechanisms for VTE in patients with different types of cancer. Preventing and treating VTE in cancer patients is challenging; the current recommendations are to use low-molecular-weight heparin. Understanding the underlying mechanisms may allow the development of new therapies to safely prevent VTE in cancer patients. "

Volume: 8 Issue: 1 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28451070/,"Background: Whereas the association between social support and psychological distress has been well-established through both cross-sectional and longitudinal studies, less is known about whether social support influences rate of change in psychological distress over time. Nor is it clear whether social support predicts baseline psychological distress, or, more importantly, whether social support may contribute to more rapid recovery following trauma exposure. Objective: This study aimed to determine the extent to which social support contributed to the recovery process among individuals with psychological distress after being exposed to trauma. Methods: Prospective survey data from ministry employees were collected 10, 22, and 34 months after the 2011 Oslo bombing that targeted the governmental quarters. We explored recovery in a clinical subsample (N = 238) of individuals with elevated levels of psychological distress (defined as mean 10-item Hopkins symptom checklist score > 1.85) one year after the event. A linear latent growth curve of psychological distress with general social support from friends and family, colleague support, and leader support as predictors was examined. Results: High levels of general social support and leader support were independently associated with a more rapid decline in psychological distress over time. Conclusions: General social support, as well as support from a leader in one's working life, may facilitate recovery from psychological distress after exposure to a traumatic event. Enhancing social support from family and friends, as well as in work settings, may benefit those with psychological distress following a traumatic workplace event."

Volume: 94 Issue: 5 Oct 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20487094/,"In general, there is a lack of scientific documentation of nutritional value of marine by-products. The bone fraction from fish has been regarded as waste. Due to the high mineral content of fish bones, this material can be well suitable as a natural calcium source. In the present study, apparent calcium absorption of different fish bone sources was tested using growing pigs. The experimental diets consisted of boiled salmon frames, or salmon, saithe or cod bones treated with enzymes. Calcium carbonate (CaCO(3)) was used as control. The experimental diets were formulated to contain 0.7% total calcium of which the added calcium source to be tested contributed about 71% (study 1) and 86% (study 2). Except for the calcium and phosphorus sources, the animals received similar basal diets. Apparent calcium digestibility coefficient was calculated using yttrium as indicator (both studies) and was based on complete collection of faeces and urine (study 2). The experimental design was parallel and cross-over in study 1 and study 2, respectively. In study 1, piglets getting salmon bone treated with enzymes had significantly higher calcium absorption than piglets getting boiled fish bone or calcium carbonate. Therefore, in the second study only enzymatically treated fish bones were included. The higher calcium absorption from enzymatically treated salmon bone was also found in study 2, but this time not significant. Calcium from boiled salmon bones in study I, and from enzymatically treated saithe and cod bones in study II were absorbed as well as the calcium carbonate control. The results indicate that fish bones may be a useful and well absorbed calcium source. Due to the high mineral content of the bone fraction, salmon bones can be well suitable as a natural calcium and phosphorus source in, for example, food, feed or as supplement."
192,Bayesian bivariate meta-analysis of diagnostic test studies with interpretable priors.,28474394,Statistics in medicine. Volume: 36 Issue: 19 Aug 30 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28474394/,"In a bivariate meta-analysis, the number of diagnostic studies involved is often very low so that frequentist methods may result in problems. Using Bayesian inference is particularly attractive as informative priors that add a small amount of information can stabilise the analysis without overwhelming the data. However, Bayesian analysis is often computationally demanding and the selection of the prior for the covariance matrix of the bivariate structure is crucial with little data. The integrated nested Laplace approximations method provides an efficient solution to the computational issues by avoiding any sampling, but the important question of priors remain. We explore the penalised complexity (PC) prior framework for specifying informative priors for the variance parameters and the correlation parameter. PC priors facilitate model interpretation and hyperparameter specification as expert knowledge can be incorporated intuitively. We conduct a simulation study to compare the properties and behaviour of differently defined PC priors to currently used priors in the field. The simulation study shows that the PC prior seems beneficial for the variance parameters. The use of PC priors for the correlation parameter results in more precise estimates when specified in a sensible neighbourhood around the truth. To investigate the usage of PC priors in practice, we reanalyse a meta-analysis using the telomerase marker for the diagnosis of bladder cancer and compare the results with those obtained by other commonly used modelling approaches.

Volume: 85 Issue: 5 May 2001,2001,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11372667/,"In a recent randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial of women with a history of venous thromboembolism (VTE), we found that hormone replacement therapy (HRT) was associated with an early excess risk of recurrent thrombosis. The aims of the present study were to characterize the effects of HRT on coagulation in these women to elucidate the mechanism(s) by which HRT increases the risk of thrombosis. The study comprised 140 women who were randomized to receive continuous treatment for 24 months with once daily 2 mg 17-beta-estradiol plus 1 mg norethisterone acetate (n = 71) or placebo (n = 69). HRT caused significant increases in prothrombin fragments 1+2, thrombin-antithrombin complex, and D-Dimer after 3 months, but these changes were less pronounced on prolonged treatment. The increases in markers of activated coagulation was higher in those women who subsequently developed recurrent thrombosis, but was similar in carriers and non-carriers of the factor V Leiden mutation. HRT had no effects on fibrinogen and factor VIII. Activated factor VII, but not factor VII antigen, decreased significantly on HRT as compared with placebo. The coagulation inhibitors antithrombin, protein C, and TFPI, but not protein S, all showed significant sustained decreases in the HRT group as compared with placebo. Antithrombin and protein C decreased by 8-12% on HRT, whereas TFPI activity decreased by 12-17% and TFPI free antigen by 29-30%. In multivariate analysis, only TFPI activity was a significant predictor for the increased activation of coagulation. We conclude that HRT was associated with early activation of coagulation, which corroborates the finding of an early risk of recurrent VTE. This activation may in part be explained by reduction in circulating anticoagulants."

Volume: 141 Issue: 22 Dec 14 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25494730/,We present a general formalism where different levels of coupled cluster theory can be applied to different parts of the molecular system. The system is partitioned into subsystems by Cholesky decomposition of the one-electron Hartree-Fock density matrix. In this way the system can be divided across chemical bonds without discontinuities arising. The coupled cluster wave function is defined in terms of cluster operators for each part and these are determined from a set of coupled equations. The total wave function fulfills the Pauli-principle across all borders and levels of electron correlation. We develop the associated response theory for this multi-level coupled cluster theory and present proof of principle applications. The formalism is an essential tool in order to obtain size-intensive complexity in the calculation of local molecular properties.

Volume: 611 Issue: 1-2 Dec 10 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16962818/,"Mice deficient in the Xeroderma pigmentosum group A (Xpa) gene are defective in nucleotide excision repair (NER) and highly susceptible to skin carcinogenesis after dermal exposure to UV light or chemicals. Min (multiple intestinal neoplasia) mice, heterozygous for a germline nonsense mutation in the tumor suppressor gene adenomatous polyposis coli (Apc), develop intestinal tumors spontaneously and show additional intestinal tumors after exposure to the food mutagen 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP). In this study, we investigated the impact of loss of XPA function on PhIP-induced intestinal tumorigenesis in F1 offspring of Min/+ (Apc(+/-)) mice crossed with Xpa gene-deficient mice. Apc(+/-) mice lacking both alleles of Xpa had higher susceptibility towards toxicity of PhIP, higher levels of PhIP-DNA adducts in the middle and distal small intestines, as well as in liver, and a higher number of small intestinal tumors at 11 weeks, compared with Apc(+/-) mice with one or two intact Xpa alleles. Localization of tumors was not affected, being highest in middle and distal small intestines in all genotypes. At 11 weeks of age, the number of spontaneous intestinal tumors was not significantly increased by homozygous loss of Xpa, but untreated Apc(+/-)/Xpa(-/-) mice had significantly shorter life-spans than their XPA-proficient littermates. Heterozygous loss of Xpa did not affect any of the measured end points. In conclusion, the Xpa gene and the NER pathway are involved in repair of bulky PhIP-DNA adducts in the intestines and the liver, and most probably of DNA lesions leading to spontaneous intestinal tumors. These results confirm a role of the NER pathway also in protection against cancer in internal organs, additional to its well-known importance in protection against skin cancer. An effect of Apc(+/-) on adduct levels, additional to that of Xpa(-/-), indicates that the truncated APC protein may affect a repair pathway other than NER."

Volume: 10 Issue: 1 01 11 2019,2019,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30635557/,"While every society can be exposed to heatwaves, some people suffer far less harm and recover more quickly than others from their occurrence. Here we project indicators of global heatwave risk associated with global warming of 1.5 and 2 °C, specified by the Paris agreement, for two future pathways of societal development representing low and high vulnerability conditions. Results suggest that at the 1.5 °C warming level, heatwave exposure in 2075 estimated for the population living in low development countries is expected to be greater than exposure at the warming level of 2 °C for the population living in very high development countries. A similar result holds for an illustrative heatwave risk index. However, the projected difference in heatwave exposure and the illustrative risk index for the low and very high development countries will be significantly reduced if global warming is stabilized below 1.5 °C, and in the presence of rapid social development."
200,Non-classical regulation of β1- and β 2-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic responses in rat heart ventricle by the G protein Gi.,25216690,Naunyn-Schmiedeberg's archives of pharmacology. Volume: 387 Issue: 12 Dec 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25216690/,"Studies suggest that increased activity of Gi contributes to the reduced β-adrenoceptor-mediated inotropic response (βAR-IR) in failing cardiomyocytes and that β2AR-IR but not β1AR-IR is blunted by dual coupling to Gs and Gi. We aimed to clarify the role of Gi upon the β1AR-IR and β2AR-IR in Sham and failing myocardium by directly measuring contractile force and cAMP accumulation. Contractility was measured ex vivo in left ventricular strips and cAMP accumulation in cardiomyocytes from rats with post-infarction heart failure (HF) or sham operates (Sham). The β2AR-IR in Sham and HF was small and was amplified by simultaneously inhibiting phosphodiesterases 3 and 4 (PDE3&4). In HF, the inotropic response and cAMP accumulation evoked by β1AR- or β2AR-stimulation were reduced. Inactivation of Gi with pertussis toxin (PTX) did not restore the β1AR-IR or β2AR-IR in HF to Sham levels but did enhance the maximal β2AR-IR. PTX increased both β1AR- and β2AR-evoked cAMP accumulation more in Sham than that in HF, and HF levels approached those in untreated Sham. The potency of agonists at β1 and at β2ARs (only under PDE3&4 inhibition) was increased in HF and by PTX in both HF and Sham. Without PDE3&4 inhibition, PTX increased only the maximal β2AR-IR, not potency. We conclude that Gi regulates both β1AR- and β2AR-IR independent of receptor coupling with Gi. Gi together with PDE3&4 tonically restrict the β2AR-IR. Gi inhibition did not restore the βAR-IR in HF despite increasing cAMP levels, suggesting that the mechanism of impairment resides downstream to cAMP signalling."

Pretreatment of the cell culture supernatants included only dilution and filtration, and the analysis time including all sample preparation steps was 60 min per sample. Peptides/proteins contained in the matrix were removed by the SCX column. LODs in the range of 8-44 pg/mL (25-120 pM) cell culture supernatant were obtained. Excellent linearity (R(2) > 0.99) and satisfactory recoveries and within- and between-day precisions were obtained. Human mesenchymal stem cells (hMSCs) were stimulated with tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNFalpha) or TNFalpha/IL-17, and PG production was analyzed using the developed method. The four PGs, 6kPGF(1a), PGF(1a), PGE(2), and PGE(1 )were detected both in nonstimulated and stimulated cells. The amount of PG produced by the cell increased when the cell was stimulated."

Experimental animal studies have delineated the principal APCs of the airway mucosa as a network of intraepithelial dendritic cells (DCs). Whether the situation is comparable in the human airways is unknown. Here we performed a detailed characterization of putative APCs residing in the normal upper airway mucosa, employing confocal microscopy of whole-mount preparations combined with immunophenotyping. A dense network of human leukocyte antigen-DR+ cells with dendritic morphology was found not only in the epithelium (median number, 573/mm2), but also in the lamina propria. In both compartments these cells could be divided into two main populations based on their phenotypic characteristics: the majority expressed a macrophage-like phenotype (CD11b+CD14+CD64+CD68+RFD7+), whereas the smaller population was predominantly constituted by CD1c+CD11c+ immature DCs intermingled with the former. These immature DCs corresponded to the lineage-negative human leukocyte antigen-DR+CD11c+ DC subset present in peripheral blood. Thus, the human upper airway mucosa, in contrast to the rodent counterpart, contains a heterogeneous dense network of dendritic APCs consisting of spatially closely related macrophages and DCs. How these two cell populations regulate the tone of the local adaptive immune system should be the focus of further studies."

Volume: 12 Issue: 12 Dec 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23755964/,"Base excision repair is the major pathway for removal of oxidative DNA base damage. This pathway is initiated by DNA glycosylases, which recognize and excise damaged bases from DNA. In this work, we have purified the glycosylase domain (GD) of human DNA glycosylase NEIL3. The substrate specificity has been characterized and we have elucidated the catalytic mechanisms. GD NEIL3 excised the hydantoin lesions spiroiminodihydantoin (Sp) and guanidinohydantoin (Gh) in single-stranded (ss) and double-stranded (ds) DNA efficiently. NEIL3 also removed 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxycytidine (5OHC) and 5-hydroxy-2'-deoxyuridine (5OHU) in ssDNA, but less efficiently than hydantoins. Unlike NEIL1 and NEIL2, which possess a β,δ-elimination activity, NEIL3 mainly incised damaged DNA by β-elimination. Further, the base excision and strand incision activities of NEIL3 exhibited a non-concerted action, indicating that NEIL3 mainly operate as a monofunctional DNA glycosylase. The site-specific NEIL3 mutant V2P, however, showed a concerted action, suggesting that the N-terminal amino group in Val2 is critical for the monofunctional modus. Finally, we demonstrated that residue Lys81 is essential for catalysis. "

The present study used DNA hybridization to examine this possibility. When DNA of a representative strain (no. 16) of the 8 1:2:1 spirochetes examined was labeled by iodination, it showed, after S1 nuclease treatment, from 58 to 104% (average 76%) homology with DNA from the 1:2:1 spirochetes, 94% homology with DNA from the type strain of Treponema socranskii and of T. socranskii subsp. socranskii, i.e., ATCC 35536T, and 62% homology with DNA from T. socranskii subsp. buccale, strain ATCC 35534T. Similarly treated DNA from a representative strain (no. 3) of 8 2:4:2 spirochetes exhibited from 90 to 105% (average 97%) homology with DNA from the 2:4:2 spirochetes, and 85% and 87% homology, respectively, with DNA from Treponema denticola strains ATCC 33520 and FDC T1. There was a negligible degree of homology between the 1:2:1 and 2:4:2 spirochetes. Thus, all the 2:4:2 spirochetes belonged to T. denticola. 1:2:2 strains with DNA homology levels >70% (5 strains) belonged to T. socranskii or T. socranskii subsp. socranskii, while those with homology levels from 58 to 63% (3 strains) most likely belonged to other subspecies of T. socranskii."

Average fish size per group ranged from 597 to 1763 g. One tank or net pen per species, dietary group and water salinity was used. In vitro nutrient transport (D-glucose, the L-amino acids aspartate, lysine, methionine, phenylalanine and proline, and the dipeptide glycyl-sarcosine) was measured using intact tissue (everted sleeve method) from the different postgastric intestinal regions. The dimensions of the different intestinal regions were also measured for each treatment group. Results indicate that SBM causes decreased carrier-mediated transport and increased permeability of distal intestinal epithelium for the nutrients, and the capacity of this region to absorb nutrient was diminished. Salinity may also affect the relative contribution of carrier-mediated and independent uptake to total nutrient absorption."

Incontinence and cognitive/functional impairment make collection of urine samples difficult and often require either catheterization for sample collection, which is a risk factor for infections, or more lenient criteria for initiating antibiotic treatment.

The developed diaper inlay was capable of collecting, isolating, analyzing samples and retaining results > 8 h. The diaper inlay can therefore be compatible with the diaper changing routines of nurses in home care services, without requiring much time or effort. A nurse can insert a diaper inlay in a diaper and the results can be recorded during a later diaper change. Although the research focuses on tools for home care services, the nursing home sector has similar problems and may benefit from technological development for rapid screening to avoid unnecessary catheterization and overuse of antibiotics."

Cerebellar cortical depositions of the tracer were made by pressure injections, while nuclear depositions were made by implanting the tracer in crystalline form. The projection is bilateral with an ipsilateral preponderance. It reaches all the cerebellar nuclei as well as vermal, intermediate and lateral parts of the cerebellar cortex. The highest cell counts were made after tracer depositions in vermal and intermediate parts of the cerebellum. The projection in the cat has a more widespread origin than previously reported. It originates mainly within the nucleus locus coeruleus and the parabrachial nucleus (especially in its lateral subdivision), but retrogradely labelled neurons were also found in nucleus subcoeruleus, the Kölliker-Fuse nucleus and the A4 cell group. The cells of origin were of different shapes, but usually had a maximum diameter of the cell body between 15 and 30 micron. Cerebellar efferent axons passing through the locus coeruleus complex were anterogradely labelled following implants in all the cerebellar nuclei, but definite terminal labelling was not observed within the nuclei of the locus coeruleus complex."

We compared the frequency of muscular symptoms and function, neuromuscular diseases and risk factors between 120 cases with persistent hyperCKemia and 130 age- and sex-matched controls with normal CK values, all recruited from the single-centre, population-based prospective Tromsø Study. The participants underwent a standardized interview assessing muscle symptoms, physical activity, use of statins and presence of other CK risk factors, prior to clinical neurological and neurophysiological examination. Knee extensor muscle strength (Cybex NORM dynamometer) and dominant hand grip strength (Martin Vigorimeter) was assessed. A total of 85 cases (71%) reported either muscle pain, muscle stiffness or cramps, compared to 70 controls (54%) (p=0.017) There were no differences in muscle strength between the groups. In men, weight, Body Mass Index and muscle symptoms were significantly higher in the group with persistent hyperCKemia. In women, no differences between the groups were detected. Use of statins was similar in cases and controls. We diagnosed 3 women with previously unknown myopathy, all in the group with persistent hyperCKemia.

Volume: 281 Issue: 30 Jul 28 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16728394/,"The cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PKA I and II) and the cAMP-stimulated GDP exchange factors (Epac1 and -2) are major cAMP effectors. The cAMP affinity of the PKA holoenzyme has not been determined previously. We found that cAMP bound to PKA I with a K(d) value (2.9 microM) similar to that of Epac1. In contrast, the free regulatory subunit of PKA type I (RI) had K(d) values in the low nanomolar range. The cAMP sites of RI therefore appear engineered to respond to physiological cAMP concentrations only when in the holoenzyme form, whereas Epac can respond in its free form. Epac is phylogenetically younger than PKA, and its functional cAMP site has presumably evolved from site B of PKA. A striking feature is the replacement of a conserved Glu in PKA by Gln (Epac1) or Lys (Epac2). We found that such a switch (E326Q) in site B of human RIalpha led to a 280-fold decreased cAMP affinity. A similar single switch early in Epac evolution could therefore have decreased the high cAMP affinity of the free regulatory subunit sufficiently to allow Epac to respond to physiologically relevant cAMP levels. Molecular dynamics simulations and cAMP analog mapping indicated that the E326Q switch led to flipping of Tyr-373, which normally stacks with the adenine ring of cAMP. Combined molecular dynamics simulation, GRID analysis, and cAMP analog mapping of wild-type and mutated BI and Epac1 revealed additional differences, independent of the Glu/Gln switch, between the binding sites, regarding space (roominess), hydrophobicity/polarity, and side chain flexibility. This helped explain the specificity of current cAMP analogs and, more importantly, lays a foundation for the generation of even more discriminative analogs."

Volume: 92 Issue: 5 May 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21652465/,"Crosses between genetically close and distant populations of Dalechampia scandens (Euphorbiaceae) were made to test whether the responses of various fitness components and measurements of developmental stability were affected by the outcrossing distance (level of outbreeding). Two fecundity traits, seed set and seed mass, decreased consistently with increasing level of outbreeding, and hybrids between the most divergent populations were sterile. Effects of the genetic distance between parental populations on viability traits, survival and vigor at 1 month of age, were highly idiosyncratic. Hybrids of one long-distance combination had no reduction in survival and vigor, while both traits were greatly reduced in the other long-distance combination. The expression of outbreeding depression on fecundity traits differed between reciprocal crosses in some hybrids but not others; thus, hybrid breakdown may have been due to cytoplasmic-by-nuclear gene interactions, reduced endosperm formation, or an interaction between progeny and maternal genotype. None of the measures of developmental stability had a consistent relationship with either genetic distance between parental populations or seedling vigor. These results suggest that fecundity and viability traits may be differentially affected by hybridization, probably due to differences in genetic architecture among populations. This study also confirms that developmental stability, as measured by the level of fluctuating asymmetry, is not a reliable index of genetic stress."

Only the Moran model converges uniformly to the diffusion limit near the boundary. The Wright-Fisher model allows the population size to change with the generations. Diffusion theory tends to under-predict the loss of genetic information when a population enters a bottleneck."

227,Heat and mass transfer across interfaces in complex nanogeometries.,25723229,Physical review letters. Volume: 114 Issue: 6 Feb 13 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25723229/,"Heat and mass transfer in nanodevices depends much on the geometry due to the strong influence of curvature on interfacial properties, such as the Kapitza resistance. We present a method which combines nonequilibrium square gradient theory and nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations to obtain the coefficients in a curvature expansion of the interface transfer coefficients. The expansion can be used directly to describe heat and mass transfer in complex nanogeometries. As examples of complex nanogeometries, we consider an oblate spheroidal droplet, a prolate spheroidal bubble, and a toroidal bubble. Depending on the sign and magnitude of the curvature, transfer is enhanced or reduced significantly. The presented method is applicable to many types of interfaces and substances, and we expect it to contribute to the understanding and design of future nanodevices. "

Volume: 190 Issue: 2 Aug 1994,1994,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7818085/,"Neuromuscular junctions on fast and slow skeletal muscle fibers have different properties. Possible reasons for these differences were examined in adult rat soleus (SOL) muscle fibers reinnervated at new ectopic or old denervated sites by fast fibular (FIB) or slow SOL motoneurons. FIB motoneurons formed large ectopic junctions with a high density of nerve terminal varicosities (fast appearance), whereas SOL motoneurons formed small ectopic junctions with a low density of varicosities (slow appearance). Both FIB and SOL motoneurons formed small junctions with a slow appearance when reinnervating old SOL endplates. FIB nerves innervating ectopic sites and SOL nerves reinnervating old sites had the same appearance whether they contacted the SOL fibers alone (single innervation) or together (dual innervation). Continuous stimulation of the FIB nerve at 10 Hz for 3-4 months reduced the size of ectopic FIB and intact extensor digitorum longus (EDL) junctions and caused a modest reduction in density of terminal varicosities in EDL. Junction size and muscle fiber diameter were positively correlated, but the slope describing this relation was steeper for FIB junctions than for SOL junctions. It is concluded that in the present system (1) motoneuron type and not muscle fiber type determines the fast or slow character of the neuromuscular junction. (2) denervated endplates of one type place stable and severe constraints on the termination pattern of reinnervating axons of another type, (3) the appearance of fast EDL junctions undergoes a modest fast to slow transformation when exposed to long-term slow pattern stimulation, and (4) not only the size of the muscle fibers, but also the type and firing pattern of the motoneurons and the spatial constraints at preformed endplates influence the relation between junction size and muscle fiber diameter."

Methods We examined 67 patients with functioning grafts (SPK n=30, PTA n=37) transplanted between September 2011 and November 2016 who underwent repeated oral glucose tolerance tests (OGTTs) 8 and 52 weeks after transplantation. Another 19 patients lost their graft the first year post-transplant and 28 patients did not undergo repeated OGTTs and could not be studied. All patients received ATG induction therapy plus tacrolimus, mycophenolate and prednisolone. Glomerular filtration rate was measured before and 8 and 52 weeks after transplantation by serum clearance methods. Results From week 8 to 52 after transplantation mean fasting glucose decreased (SPK 5.4±0.7 to 5.1±0.8 mmol/L, PTA: 5.4±0.6 to 5.2±0.7 mmol/L; both p<0.05), and also 120-minute post-OGTT glucose (SPK 6.9±2.9 to 5.7±2.2 mmol/L; p=0.07, PTA: 6.5±1.7 to 5.7±1.2 mmol/L; p<0.05).

The lipophilic AIPCS2a was distributed mainly in tumor cells, while the hydrophilic AIPCS4 localized only in the vascular stroma of the tumor tissue. Concomitantly, comparative observations on the killing mechanism of photodynamic effects after treatment with a much lower i.v. dose of AIPCS2a and AIPCS4 plus laser light on the human tumor LOX were also made by morphological studies. Light and electron microscopy showed that there was a direct, extensive, photo-damaging action on all organelles and nuclear structure in the tumor cells after PDT with AIPCS2a; whereas the photo-induced injury to the tumor tissue after treatment with AIPCS4 and light was largely the consequence of initial functional vasogenic response and ultimate damage to vascular structure. These findings correlate well with the different localization patterns of the 2 dyes observed in human tumor tissues."

Palmitate oxidation was increased by 2.2-fold in 6-week-old db/db hearts and remained elevated in 10- to 12- and 16- to 18-week-old hearts. Carbohydrate oxidation was normal at 6 weeks but was reduced to 27 and 23% of control at 10-12 and 16-18 weeks, respectively. At 6 weeks, db/db hearts exhibited a slight reduction in mechanical function, whereas marked signs of dysfunction were evident at 10-12 and 16-18 weeks. Mechanical function after ischemia-reperfusion was examined in hearts from male mice; at 6 weeks, db/db hearts showed normal recovery, whereas at 12 weeks it was markedly reduced. Fatty acid oxidation was the predominant substrate used after reperfusion. Thus, diabetic db/db hearts exhibit signs of a progressive cardiomyopathy; increased fatty acid oxidation preceded reductions in carbohydrate oxidation. Postischemic recovery of function was reduced in db/db hearts, in parallel with age-dependent changes in normoxic contractile performance. Finally, peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-alpha treatment (3 weeks) did not affect sensitivity to ischemia-reperfusion, even though carbohydrate oxidation was increased and palmitate oxidation was decreased."

Volume: 159 Issue: 1 Jan 02 1989,1989,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2707302/,"The calcium antagonist diltiazem (2.8 X 10(-4) M) blocked the twitches of a rat phrenic nerve diaphragm preparation after a period of twitch potentiation. Its ability to block twitches was greater during indirect than direct stimulation. Experiments on the isolated phrenic nerve indicated that the excitability of the nerve was blocked. Diltiazem (2.3-9.0 X 10(-5) M) caused a similar inhibition of indirectly and directly elicited tetanic contractions and EMG. Experiments with d-tubocurarine and lowered temperature disclosed a separate inhibition at the neuromuscular junction. High Ca2+ did not reverse the diltiazem-affected twitch or tetanic contractions, which suggests that they are non-specific effects. KCl (100 mM)-induced contractures were antagonized at low (2.3-4.5 X 10(-5) M) but not at high (1 mM) concentrations of diltiazem. Diltiazem depressed the initial phase of the two-phasic caffeine (10 mM) contracture and increased and accelerated the slow phase. Diltiazem greatly reduced the amplitude and duration of the caffeine-potentiated KCl contracture, and reduced and delayed the slow phase of the KCl-potentiated caffeine contracture. The effects on the combined contractures (caffeine-induced, KCl-potentiated) were partly antagonized by a high Ca2+ (2.2 X 10(-5) M) solution, which suggests that diltiazem has calcium antagonistic effects."

Volume: 126 Sep 05 2013",2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23954345/,Alveld is a hepatogenous photosensitivity disorder in lambs. The aim of the study was to investigate if alveld affected lambs had a reduced capacity to handle oxidative stress induced from either endogenous and/or exogenous photosensitizers. Serum samples from alveld lambs (n=33) were compared to serum samples from control lambs (n=31) and exposed to a controlled amount of singlet oxygen ((1)O2). The sera from alveld lambs were found to have an impaired ability to deactivate reactive oxygen species (ROS) compared to control sera. A higher degree of initial hemolysis and a higher concentration of the exogenous photosensitizer phytoporphyrin (PP) were detected in alveld sera compared to the controls. The action spectrum for the formation of (1)O2 indicated that PP as well as the endogenous compound protoporphyrin IX (PP IX) may act as in vivo photosensitizers. A relatively high level of iron was detected in pooled serum from alveld lambs that showed a high degree of hemolysis. It was concluded that alveld photosensitivity is likely to be initiated by a photodynamic reaction involving PP and possibly also PP IX followed by a light-independent reaction involving hemoglobin-related products and catalysis by the Fenton reaction.

The two methods and the four antibodies gave consistent results. The six melanoma lines could be divided into three distinct groups of two lines each; expression was high in the HUX-t and ROX-t lines and intermediate in the BEX-t and SAX-t lines, whereas the COX-t and WIX-t lines were negative. The mean number of epitopes per cell for 9.2.27 was approximately twice as high as for ME31.3, G7A5, and NKI.M6 and was estimated to range from 0.8 +/- 0.1 x 10(5) to 1.9 +/- 0.2 x 10(5) in the positive xenograft lines. The expression of the CSP complex was heterogeneous. The immunofluorescence histograms measured by flow cytometry were therefore broad for all tumour lines. A significant fraction of the HUX-t cells was negative or weakly stained. These cells appeared as clear negative patches in the immunohistochemical preparations. Moreover, most morphologically intact tumour cells adjacent to necrotic areas did not show significant expression of the CSP complex, irrespective of tumour line. These cells were probably hypoxic and thus resistant to radiation therapy. The expression of the CSP complex in the xenograft lines was similar to that reported for melanoma in man."

In this pilot study, a mixed-methods approach was used to examine the potential of using exercise in a natural environment to enhance exercise behaviors. The study included an assessment study and an intervention study (overall n = 19). The participants underwent a standardized exercise program including biking and circuit strength training, either indoors or outdoors in nature. Measurements included connectedness to nature, perceived exertion, perceived environmental restorativeness, enjoyment, affect, future exercise intention, and self-reported exercise behavior. The participants also wrote a brief text describing the way in which the environment influenced their feelings while exercising. Quantitative data were analyzed using the Spearman rank correlation and linear mixed-effects modeling. The qualitative information was analyzed thematically. The integrated results indicated that, in accordance with ART, exercising in nature was associated with a greater potential for restoration and affective responses, which in some participants led to enhanced intention to exercise and increased exercise behavior. However, some perceived that the indoor exercise provided a more effective workout. Further studies on larger samples are needed."

This study's aim was to test the effects of self-transcendence on depression among cognitively intact nursing home patients. Background. Depression is considered the most frequent mental disorder among the elderly population. Specifically, the depression rate among nursing home patients is three to four times higher than that among community-dwelling elderly. Therefore, finding new and alternative ways to prevent and decrease depression is of great importance for nursing home patients' well-being. Self-transcendence is related to spiritual as well as nonspiritual factors, and it is described as a correlate and resource for well-being among vulnerable populations and at the end of life. Methods. A two-factor construct of the self-transcendence scale (interpersonal and intrapersonal) and the hospital anxiety and depression scale (HADS) was applied. A sample of 202 cognitively intact nursing home patients in central Norway was selected to respond to the questionnaires in 2008/2009. Results. A hypothesized SEM model demonstrated significant direct relationships and total effects of self-transcendence on depression. Conclusion and Implication for Practice. Facilitating patients' self-transcendence, both interpersonally and intrapersonally, might decrease depression among cognitively intact nursing home patients."

Different mechanisms are responsible for these adjustments for a variety of climate drivers. These remain to be quantified in detail. It is shown that rapid adjustments reduce the effective radiative forcing (ERF) of black carbon by half of the instantaneous forcing, but for CO2 forcing, rapid adjustments increase ERF. Competing tropospheric adjustments for CO2 forcing are individually significant but sum to zero, such that the ERF equals the stratospherically adjusted radiative forcing, but this is not true for other forcing agents. Additional experiments of increase in the solar constant and increase in CH4 are used to show that a key factor of the rapid adjustment for an individual climate driver is changes in temperature in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere."

Previous studies have only focused on age with regard to first onset of AVHs. In the current epidemiological study, we examined a number of aspects relating to first onset of AVHs, such as the role of adverse life events at first onset of AVHs on symptom severity and general mental health. For this purpose, we compared participants who reported adverse life events at first onset of AHVs (adverse-trigger group; N = 76) to those that did not report any specific events at first onset of AVHs (no-adverse-trigger group; N = 59) on a large array of variables. Results showed that AVHs in the adverse-trigger group were experienced as more emotional compared to the no-adverse-trigger group. In addition, the adverse-trigger group more often reported hallucinations in other (non-auditory) sensory modalities (e.g. visual) compared to the no-adverse-trigger group. Furthermore, the adverse-trigger group reported poorer general mental health, reported having contact with mental health professionals more often, and also reported more frequently taking medication for psychological problems in general. The implications of these findings are discussed."

Volume: 8 Issue: 3 Mar 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17304239/,"In plants, chloroplast division is an integral part of development, and these vital organelles arise by binary fission from pre-existing cytosolic plastids. Chloroplasts arose by endosymbiosis and although they have retained elements of the bacterial cell division machinery to execute plastid division, they have evolved to require two functionally distinct forms of the FtsZ protein and have lost elements of the Min machinery required for Z-ring placement. Here, we analyse the plastid division component accumulation and replication of chloroplasts 3 (ARC3) and show that ARC3 forms part of the stromal plastid division machinery. ARC3 interacts specifically with AtFtsZ1, acting as a Z-ring accessory protein and defining a unique function for this family of FtsZ proteins. ARC3 is involved in division site placement, suggesting that it might functionally replace MinC, representing an important advance in our understanding of the mechanism of chloroplast division and the evolution of the chloroplast division machinery."

This reagent, ImmTAC-NYE, is shown to kill HLA-A2, antigen-positive tumor cell lines, and freshly isolated HLA-A2- and LAGE-1-positive NSCLC cells. Employing time-domain optical imaging, we demonstrate in vivo targeting of fluorescently labelled high-affinity NYESO-specific TCRs to HLA-A2-, NY-ESO-1157-165-positive tumors in xenografted mice. In vivo ImmTAC-NYE efficacy was tested in a tumor model in which human lymphocytes were stably co-engrafted into NSG mice harboring tumor xenografts; efficacy was observed in both tumor prevention and established tumor models using a GFP fluorescence readout. Quantitative RT-PCR was used to analyze the expression of both NY-ESO-1 and LAGE-1 antigens in 15 normal tissues, 5 cancer cell lines, 10 NSCLC, and 10 ovarian cancer samples. Overall, LAGE-1 RNA was expressed at a greater frequency and at higher levels than NY-ESO-1 in the tumor samples. These data support the clinical utility of ImmTAC-NYE as an immunotherapeutic agent for a variety of cancers."

CA frequency in peripheral blood is a marker of cancer susceptibility. Previous studies have shown associations between genetic variants in metabolic pathway, DNA repair and major mitotic checkpoint genes and CAs. We conducted a genome-wide association study on 576 individuals from the Czech Republic and Slovakia followed by a replication in two different sample sets of 482 (replication 1) and 1288 (replication 2) samples. To have a broad look at the genetic susceptibility associated with CA frequency, the sample sets composed of individuals either differentially exposed to smoking, occupational/environmental hazards, or they were untreated cancer patients. Phenotypes were divided into chromosome- and chromatid-type aberrations (CSAs and CTAs, respectively) and total chromosomal aberrations (CAtot). The arbitrary cutoff point between individuals with high and low CA frequency was 2% for CAtot and 1% for CSA and CTA. The data were analyzed using age, sex, occupation/cancer and smoking history as covariates. Altogether 11 loci reached the P-value of 10-5 in the GWAS. Replication 1 supported the association of rs1383997 (8q13.3) and rs2824215 (21q21.1) in CAtot and rs983889 (5p15.1) in CTA analysis. These loci were found to be associated with genes involved in mitosis, response to environmental and chemical factors and genes involved in syndromes linked to chromosomal abnormalities.

Volume: 11 Issue: 1 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15829044/,"Teleradiology requires cooperation between participating parties, but it cannot be assumed that such cooperation will work well. A survey was carried out of 12 radiology departments in Norway which used picture archiving and communication systems in connection with teleradiology. Qualitative interviews were carried out with 26 out of 29 resource persons (response rate 90%). The respondents identified 17 issues of importance for cooperation in teleradiology. None of the problems with cooperation seem large enough to prevent effective teleradiology cooperation in future. For organizations planning teleradiology of a larger volume, the cooperation issue is important. It is recommended that managers lead change processes in their organizations where the different issues of importance to cooperation are treated and the right measures are taken to realize the full potential of teleradiology. For telemedicine, it is important that future research includes investigations on cooperation for the different applications."
256,Reduction in direction discrimination with age and slow speed is due to both increased internal noise and reduced sampling efficiency.,23800764,Investigative ophthalmology & visual science. Volume: 54 Issue: 8 Aug 05 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23800764/,Sensitivity to moving structure decreases with age and slow speeds may be selectively impaired. This loss could be caused by elevated internal noise in the responses of motion sensors or a reduction in the efficiency with which motion responses are integrated. We adapt an equivalent noise paradigm to analyze the perception of slow and fast speed motion as a function of normal aging.
257,A mouse C kappa-specific T cell clone indicates that DC-SIGN is an efficient target for antibody-mediated delivery of T cell epitopes for MHC class II presentation.,12456590,International immunology. Volume: 14 Issue: 12 Dec 2002,2002,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12456590/,"In vaccine development, a major objective is to induce strong, specific T cell responses. This might be obtained by targeting antigen to cell surface molecules that efficiently channel the antigen into endocytic compartments for loading of MHC molecules. Antibodies have been used to deliver antigen; however, it is important to define optimal targets on antigen-presenting cells (APC) for efficient delivery. For this purpose, we have established a T cell readout that can be used to screen large numbers of different mAb for their ability to load MHC class II molecules. The novel human CD4+ T cell clone is specific for mouse Ig C kappa (40-48) and restricted by HLA-DR4 (DRA1,B1*0401). DR4 apparently presents both mouse and human C kappa 40-48, but there is no cross-reaction at the T cell level. B cells from DR4 transgenic mice spontaneously process and present the mouse C kappa peptide. The mouse C kappa -specific T cell readout was used to demonstrate that mouse mAb specific for human dendritic cell (DC)-specific ICAM-grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN), a novel DC-specific molecule, were 10- to 1000-fold more potent at inducing kappa-specific human CD4+ T cell proliferation compared to control mAb. Consistent with this finding, DC-SIGN-specific mAb were rapidly internalized upon binding and found in intracellular vesicles. These results strongly argue that DC-SIGN-specific mAb are channeled into the MHC class II presentation pathway. Thus, DC-SIGN could be an efficient target for antibody-mediated delivery of T cell epitopes in vaccine development."

Volume: 74 Issue: 1 Jan 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28417790/,"Background Suicide is a widespread problem among indigenous people residing in the circumpolar Arctic. Though the situation among the indigenous Sami in northern Scandinavia is better than among some other indigenous people, suicide is still regarded as a major public health issue. To adapt prevention strategies that are culturally attuned one must understand how suicide is understood within context. That is, the cultural meaning(s) of suicide. Objective To explore and make sense of the cultural meaning(s) of suicide among Sami in Sweden. Design Open-ended focus group discussions (FGDs) on the topic ""suicide among Sami"" were carried out in 5 Sami communities in Sweden, with in total 22 strategically selected Sami participants. FGDs were recorded, transcribed verbatim and analyzed through employing content analysis. Results From the FGDs 4 themes emerged including ""The Sami are fighting for their culture and the herders are in the middle of the fight,"" ""Suicide as a consequence of Sami losing (or having lost) their identity,"" ""A wildfire in the Sami world"" and ""Difficult to get help as a Sami."" Conclusions Findings indicate that Sami in Sweden make sense of suicide in relation to power and identity within a threatened Sami cultural context. Suicide is then understood as an act that takes place and makes sense to others when a Sami no longer has the power to maintain a Sami identity, resulting in being disconnected from the Sami world and placed in an existential void where suicide is a solution. The findings are useful in development of culturally attuned suicide prevention among Sami in Sweden."

Volume: 15 Issue: 8 Aug 13 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25123137/,"The objectives of the present study were two-fold: first, to detect whether salmon protein fractions possess angiotensin I-converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitory properties and whether salmon proteins can release ACE inhibitory peptides during a sequential in vitro hydrolysis (with commercial porcine enzymes) and ex vivo digestion (with human gastrointestinal enzymes). Secondly, to evaluate the ACE inhibitory activity of generated hydrolysates. A two-step ex vivo and in vitro model digestion was performed to simulate the human digestion process. Salmon proteins were degraded more efficiently by porcine enzymes than by human gastrointestinal juices and sarcoplasmic proteins were digested/hydrolyzed more easily than myofibrillar proteins. The ex vivo digested myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic duodenal samples showed IC50 values (concentration required to decrease the ACE activity by 50%) of 1.06 and 2.16 mg/mL, respectively. The in vitro hydrolyzed myofibrillar and sarcoplasmic samples showed IC50 values of 0.91 and 1.04 mg/mL, respectively. Based on the results of in silico studies, it was possible to identify 9 peptides of the ex vivo hydrolysates and 7 peptides of the in vitro hydrolysates of salmon proteins of 11 selected peptides. In both types of salmon hydrolysates, ACE-inhibitory peptides IW, IY, TVY and VW were identified. In the in vitro salmon protein hydrolysates an ACE-inhibitory peptides VPW and VY were also detected, while ACE-inhibitory peptides ALPHA, IVY and IWHHT were identified in the hydrolysates generated with ex vivo digestion. In our studies, we documented ACE inhibitory in vitro effects of salmon protein hydrolysates obtained by human and as well as porcine gastrointestinal enzymes. "

267,¹³C labelled internal standards--a solution to minimize ion suppression effects in liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry analyses of drugs in biological samples?,22119139,Journal of chromatography. A. Volume: 1218 Issue: 52 Dec 30 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22119139/,"Liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) is frequently used to identify and quantify drugs in human biological samples due to the high selectivity and sensitivity of this technique. However, ion suppression effects caused by co-eluting compounds: drugs, metabolites, matrix components, impurities and degradation products, are a major concern. Stable isotope labelled internal standards (SIL ISs), usually deuterium ((2)H) labelled, are often used to compensate for these effects. In many LC separations the retention times of (2)H labelled ISs and their analogues will differ. Ultra performance liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS/MS) is increasingly being used for bio-analysis. With the better chromatographic resolution provided with sub 2 μm particles, larger separation between analytes and their (2)H labelled analogues can be expected, which might reduce the benefits of the SIL IS. There is a greater difference in physico-chemical properties between hydrogen isotopes than between isotopes of other elements. (13)C, (15)N and (18)O labelled ISs are more similar to their analytes than (2)H labelled ISs and thereby expected to behave more similarly in chromatographic separations. In this study we have investigated the use of (13)C and (2)H labelled ISs for the determination of amphetamine and methamphetamine by UPLC-MS/MS. The (13)C labelled ISs were co eluting with their analytes under different chromatographic conditions while the (2)H labelled ISs and their analytes were slightly separated. An improved ability to compensate for ion suppression effects were observed when the (13)C labelled ISs were used. Furthermore, an UPLC-MS/MS method for determination of amphetamine and methamphetamine in urine using (13)C labelled ISs has been developed and validated. Unfortunately, there are few (13)C labelled ISs commercial available today. If more (13)C labelled ISs become commercial available they may well be the coming solution to minimize ion suppression/enhancement effects in LC-MS/MS analyses of drugs in biological samples."

The human fetus seems to circulate less blood through the placenta, shunt less through the ductus venosus and foramen ovale, but direct more blood through the lungs than the fetal sheep. However, there are substantial individual variations and the pattern changes with gestational age. The normalised umbilical blood flow decreases with gestational age, and, at 28 to 32 weeks, a new level of development seems to be reached. At this stage, the shunting through the ductus venosus and the foramen ovale reaches a minimum, and the flow through the lungs a maximum. The ductus venosus and foramen ovale are functionally closely related and represent an important distributional unit for the venous return. The left portal branch represents a venous watershed, and, similarly, the isthmus aorta an arterial watershed. Thus, the fetal central circulation is a very flexible and adaptive circulatory system. The responses to increased afterload, hypoxaemia and acidaemia in the human fetus are equivalent to those found in animal studies: increased ductus venosus and foramen ovale shunting, increased impedance in the lungs, reduced impedance in the brain, increasingly reversed flow in the aortic isthmus and a more prominent coronary blood flow."

Volume: 47 Issue: 2,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26991283/,"The development of showerhead biofilms exposes the user to repeated contact with potentially pathogenic microbes, yet we know relatively little about the content of these aggregates. The aim of the present study was to examine the microbial content of tape-like films found protruding from a domestic showerhead. Culturing showed that the films were dominated by aerobic α- and β-proteobacteria. Three isolates made up almost the entire plate count. These were a Brevundimonas species, a metalophilic Cupriavidus species and a thermophile, Geobacillus species. Furthermore, it was shown that the Cupriavidus isolate alone had a high capacity for biofilm formation and thus might be the initiator of biofilm production. A clone library revealed the same general composition. However, half of the 70 clones analyzed could not be assigned to a particular bacterial phylum and of these 29 differed from one another by only 1-2 base pairs, indicating a single species. Thus both the culture dependent and culture independent characterizations suggest a simple yet novel composition. The work is important as the biofilm is fundamentally different in form (tape-like) and content from that of all previously reported ones, where variously Mycobacterium, Methylobacterium and Xanthomonas species have dominated, and extremophiles were not reported.

Volume: 117 Aug 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29747082/,"There is growing understanding that the environment plays an important role both in the transmission of antibiotic resistant pathogens and in their evolution.

There is a clear value in establishing research needs and coordinating efforts within and across nations in order to best tackle this global challenge. At an international workshop in late September 2017, scientists from 14 countries with expertise on the environmental dimensions of antibiotic resistance gathered to define critical knowledge gaps. Four key areas were identified where research is urgently needed: 1) the relative contributions of different sources of antibiotics and antibiotic resistant bacteria into the environment; 2) the role of the environment, and particularly anthropogenic inputs, in the evolution of resistance; 3) the overall human and animal health impacts caused by exposure to environmental resistant bacteria; and 4) the efficacy and feasibility of different technological, social, economic and behavioral interventions to mitigate environmental antibiotic resistance.1."

For the 5% most central collisions, we measure a value of 1943±54. The rise in dN_{ch}/dη as a function of sqrt[s_{NN}] is steeper than that observed in proton-proton collisions and follows the trend established by measurements at lower energy. The increase of dN_{ch}/dη as a function of the average number of participant nucleons, ⟨N_{part}⟩, calculated in a Glauber model, is compared with the previous measurement at sqrt[s_{NN}]=2.76  TeV. A constant factor of about 1.2 describes the increase in dN_{ch}/dη from sqrt[s_{NN}]=2.76 to 5.02 TeV for all centrality classes, within the measured range of 0%-80% centrality. The results are also compared to models based on different mechanisms for particle production in nuclear collisions. "

Volume: 43 Issue: 7 Apr 20 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25779047/,"Selective pressure to maintain small genome size implies control of transposable elements, and most old classes of retrotransposons are indeed absent from the very compact genome of the tunicate Oikopleura dioica. Nonetheless, two families of retrotransposons are present, including the Tor elements. The gene organization within Tor elements is similar to that of LTR retrotransposons and retroviruses. In addition to gag and pol, many Tor elements carry a third gene encoding viral envelope-like proteins (Env) that may mediate infection. We show that the Tor family contains distinct classes of elements. In some classes, env mRNA is transcribed from the 5'LTR as in retroviruses. In others, env is transcribed from an additional promoter located downstream of the 5'LTR. Tor Env proteins are membrane-associated glycoproteins which exhibit some features of viral membrane fusion proteins. Whereas some elements are expressed in the adult testis, many others are specifically expressed in embryonic somatic cells adjacent to primordial germ cells. Such embryonic expression depends on determinants present in the Tor elements and not on their surrounding genomic environment. Our study shows that unusual modes of transcription and expression close to the germline may contribute to the proliferation of Tor elements. "
274,Gene flow from domesticated species to wild relatives: migration load in a model of multivariate selection.,19663990,Evolution; international journal of organic evolution. Volume: 64 Issue: 1 Jan 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19663990/,"Domesticated species frequently spread their genes into populations of wild relatives through interbreeding. The domestication process often involves artificial selection for economically desirable traits. This can lead to an indirect response in unknown correlated traits and a reduction in fitness of domesticated individuals in the wild. Previous models for the effect of gene flow from domesticated species to wild relatives have assumed that evolution occurs in one dimension. Here, I develop a quantitative genetic model for the balance between migration and multivariate stabilizing selection. Different forms of correlational selection consistent with a given observed ratio between average fitness of domesticated and wild individuals offsets the phenotypic means at migration-selection balance away from predictions based on simpler one-dimensional models. For almost all parameter values, correlational selection leads to a reduction in the migration load. For ridge selection, this reduction arises because the distance the immigrants deviates from the local optimum in effect is reduced. For realistic parameter values, however, the effect of correlational selection on the load is small, suggesting that simpler one-dimensional models may still be adequate in terms of predicting mean population fitness and viability."

Cryostat sections were used in indirect immunofluorescence technique. Fc gamma R were detected on varying numbers of cells in the inflammatory cell infiltrates, on endothelial cells of certain vessels and in fibrous tissue. In chronic marginal periodontitis Fc gamma R were also observed on cells within the oral gingival epithelium (OGE) and the pocket epithelium (PE). There was a distinct fluorescence in stratum spinosum and occasionally in stratum basale of OGE and in the coronal portion of the PE. Fc gamma R on Langerhans cells could not be demonstrated. In apical periodontitis Fc gamma R were also detected on cells within the epithelium. In some cases epithelium in periapical cysts was positive. Soluble immune complexes bound to morphologically similar, but fewer cells compared to the monoclonal antibody against Fc gamma R. The results indicate that Fc gamma R are generally expressed on cells in inflamed tissue. Thus, this presence of Fc gamma R on certain specialized cells such as endothelial cells and keratinocytes, may endow these cells with functions previously thought to be restricted to cells of the lymphoreticular system."

Volume: 9 Issue: 11 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25393951/,"Inclusion of spatially explicit information on ecosystem services in conservation planning is a fairly new practice. This study analyses how the incorporation of ecosystem services as conservation features can affect conservation of forest biodiversity and how different opportunity cost constraints can change spatial priorities for conservation. We created spatially explicit cost-effective conservation scenarios for 59 forest biodiversity features and five ecosystem services in the county of Telemark (Norway) with the help of the heuristic optimisation planning software, Marxan with Zones. We combined a mix of conservation instruments where forestry is either completely (non-use zone) or partially restricted (partial use zone). Opportunity costs were measured in terms of foregone timber harvest, an important provisioning service in Telemark. Including a number of ecosystem services shifted priority conservation sites compared to a case where only biodiversity was considered, and increased the area of both the partial (+36.2%) and the non-use zone (+3.2%). Furthermore, opportunity costs increased (+6.6%), which suggests that ecosystem services may not be a side-benefit of biodiversity conservation in this area. Opportunity cost levels were systematically changed to analyse their effect on spatial conservation priorities. Conservation of biodiversity and ecosystem services trades off against timber harvest. Currently designated nature reserves and landscape protection areas achieve a very low proportion (9.1%) of the conservation targets we set in our scenario, which illustrates the high importance given to timber production at present. A trade-off curve indicated that large marginal increases in conservation target achievement are possible when the budget for conservation is increased. Forty percent of the maximum hypothetical opportunity costs would yield an average conservation target achievement of 79%. "
277,New hypothesis on the role of alternating sequences in calcium-alginate gels.,15762675,Biomacromolecules. Volume: 6 Issue: 2,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15762675/,"The availability of mannuronan and mannuronan C-5 epimerases allows the production of a strictly alternating mannuronate-guluronate (MG) polymer and the MG-enrichment of natural alginates, providing a powerful tool for the analysis of the role of such sequences in the calcium-alginate gel network. In view of the calcium binding properties of long alternating sequences revealed by circular dichroism studies which leads eventually to the formation of stable hydrogels, their direct involvement in the gel network is here suggested. In particular, 1H NMR results obtained from a mixed alginate sample containing three polymeric species, G blocks, M blocks, and MG blocks, without chemical linkages between the block structures, indicate for the first time the formation of mixed junctions between G and MG blocks. This is supported by the analysis of the Young's modulus of hydrogels from natural and epimerized samples obtained at low calcium concentrations. Furthermore, the ""zipping"" of long alternating sequences in secondary MG/MG junctions is suggested to account for the shrinking (syneresis) of alginate gels in view of its dependence on the length of the MG blocks. As a consequence, a partial network collapse, macroscopically revealed by a decrease in the Young's modulus, occurred as the calcium concentration in the gel was increased. The effect of such ""secondary"" junctions on the viscoelastic properties of alginate gels was evaluated measuring their creep compliance under uniaxial compression. The experimental curves, fitted by a model composed of a Maxwell and a Voigt element in series, revealed an increase in the frictional forces between network chains with increasing length of the alternating sequences. This suggests the presence of an ion mediated mechanism preventing the shear of the gel."

Leukocyte Biol. 67; 183-188). The aim of the present study was to investigate the kinetics of degradation of endocytosed serglycin in primary cultures of LSECs. The final degradation products of serglycin labelled biosynthetically in the glycosaminoglycan (GAG) chains with [3H] in the acetyl groups of N-acetyl galactosamine residues, [14C] in the pyranose rings, or [35S] in the sulfate groups were identified as[3H]-acetate, [14C]-lactate and [35S]-sulfate. Comparison of the rate of release of degradation products from the cells after endocytosis of serglycin labelled chemically with 125I in the tyrosine residues, or biosynthetically with [35S] or [3H] in the sulfate or acetyl groups, respectively, showed that 125I appeared more rapidly in the medium than [35S]-sulfate and [3H]-acetate. Judging from the speed of appearance of free 125I both intracellularly and in the medium, the core protein is degraded considerably more rapidly than the GAG chains. Desulfation of the GAG chains starts after the GAG chains are released from the core protein. Generation of lactate and acetate as the final products from degradation of the carbon skeleton of the GAG chains indicates that catabolism of endocytosed macromolecules in LSECs proceeds anaerobically."

One fifth needed reduction, and the distal radius was the most common fracture site (27%). Activities associated with fracture were mostly soccer and bicycling, but compared with the total number of injuries associated with each activity, we found a doubled risk of fractures during rollerblading/skating or snowboarding (60%) compared with playing soccer (38%) or bicycling (33%). Scaphoid fracture, an infrequent fracture in children, was seen in 9% of all fractures due to rollerblading/skating. There was a doubled risk of fracture in boys aged 13 to 15 compared with their female peers. To make fracture prevention more efficient, it should be targeted at this risk group and these high-risk activities. Protection of the wrist region might prevent the most common fractures."

These impairments affect the quality of life, occupational functioning, and the ability to benefit from therapy. Psychological distress also affects neurocognitive status, and impaired neurocognition characterizes several psychiatric conditions. Neurocognitive assessment is thus of importance but faces several interpretive challenges. One is disentangling the link between psychological distress and cognitive impairment. This paper investigates the associations between psychological distress and two cognitive screening tools, the Montreal Cognitive Assessment (MoCA) and the Behavior Rating Inventory of Executive Function - Adult Version (BRIEF-A) in young adults with PSUD."

We focus on the flow curvature, which induces some extra rates of strain that should be accounted for in algebraic-type turbulence closures. The comparison between the analytical formulation proposed by Brocchini and co-workers for a single-phase turbulent thin layer of fluid and the data, obtained from a Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) dedicated experimental program, reveals that the order of magnitude of the extra rates of strain induced by the streamline curvature, is comparable with that of the simple shear. This differs from what observed for the geometric curvature terms and from what occurs at hydraulic jumps, typically used to model steady breakers."

For substance use, the model that included one common genetic, one shared environmental, and one individual-specific (i.e., unique) environmental factor, along with substance-specific effects that were attributed entirely to genetic factors fit the data best. For illicit SUD, one common genetic and one common unique environmental risk factor, and substance specific shared environmental and unique environmental risk factors were identified. Risk factors for illicit substance use and SUD are mainly non-specific to substance class. Co-twin rating of illicit substance use and SUD was a reliable source of information, and by taking account of random and systematic measurement error, environmental exposures unique to the individual were of lesser importance than found in earlier studies."

The solar chromosphere, in contrast, remains little understood, although its pivotal role in coronal mass and energy loading makes it a principal research area. Its fine structure defines its overall structure, so that hard-to-observe and hard-to-model small-scale dynamical processes are key to understanding. However, both chromospheric observation and chromospheric simulation presently mature towards the required sophistication. Open-field features seem of greater interest than easier-to-see closed-field features."

Processes critical to memory formation are thought to take place during this interval of 'enhanced' rapid-eye movement sleep. We therefore compared the capacity for long-term potentiation during rapid-eye movement sleep and alert wakefulness after learning. Rats were chronically implanted with electrodes for stimulation of the perforant path and recording of evoked potentials and EEG in the dentate gyrus. After obtaining baseline recordings, rats were trained on a 40-trial two-way active avoidance task. Conditioned rats exhibited a two-fold increase in the mean duration of rapid-eye movement sleep episodes, as reflected by a prolongation of the hippocampal theta rhythm. There was no change in the sleep pattern of pseudoconditioned controls, which received explicitly unpaired tones and foot shocks in a yoked design. High-frequency stimulation was applied during the second, third, and fourth major rapid-eye movement sleep episodes after active avoidance training. Another group was tetanized at matching time points during alert wakefulness. After pseudoconditioning, tetanus applied during wakefulness or rapid-eye movement sleep readily induced long-term potentiation, and there was no difference between groups in the magnitude of increase for the population excitatory postsynaptic potential slope or the population spike height as measured 1 h, 24 h, and 5 days post-tetanus.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"
296,On the detection of mesospheric meteoric smoke particles embedded in noctilucent cloud particles with rocket-borne dust probes.,25832221,The Review of scientific instruments. Volume: 86 Issue: 3 Mar 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25832221/,"Mesospheric nanoparticles in the forms of water ice particles and meteoric smoke particles (MSPs) exist in the middle atmosphere where they often play a decisive role in cloud formation and in chemical processes. Direct in situ observations of mesospheric nanoparticles have been made possible by rocket probes developed during the last two decades. Although progress has been made in mapping properties such as electric charge, sizes, and interaction with the plasma and neutral gas, more observations are needed on the size distribution, chemical content, and structure of the MSP to determine their role in cloud formation and chemistry in the mesosphere and stratosphere. We here present the result of a detailed analysis of the performance of a new dust probe MUltiple Dust Detector (MUDD) [O. Havnes et al., J. Atmos Soll.-Terr. Phys. 118, 190 (2014); O. Havenes et al., ibid. (in press)], which should give information of the size distribution of MSP by fragmenting impacting ice particles and releasing a fraction of the MSP which most probably are embedded in them [O. Havnes and L. I. Naesheim, Ann. Geophys. 25, 623 (2007); M. E. Hervig et al., J. Atmos. Sol.-Terr. Phys. 84-85, 1 (2012)]. We first determine the electric field structure and neutral gas condition in the interior of the probe and from this compute, the dynamics and current contribution of the charged fragments to the currents measured as the probe scans the fragment energy. For the single MUDD probe flown in July 2011 on the PHOCUS payload, we find that the fragment currents at the three retarding potentials for MUDD of 0, 10, and 20 V correspond to fragment sizes of ≳0.6 nm, >1.5 nm, and >1.8 nm if the fragments have a negative unit charge. We also discuss the optimum choice of retarding potentials in future flights of MUDD probes. By launching 2 to 3 mechanically identical MUDD probes but with different retarding potentials, we will obtain a much more detailed and reliable fragment (MSP) size distribution. "

Volume: 24 Issue: 35 Dec 10 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17158535/,"Late relapses of malignant germ cell tumors (MGCTs) are rare and occur, by definition, 2 years or later after successful treatment. They represent a major challenge of today's treatment of MGCTs. Because of the rarity and heterogeneity of late relapses, many aspects of their main characteristics remain obscure. We present relevant literature on relapsing MGCTs to highlight the following issues: incidence, impact of initial treatment on the subsequent risk of late relapse, treatment, and survival. In a pooled analysis, the incidence is 1.4% and 3.2% in seminoma and nonseminoma patients, respectively. The predominant site of relapse is the retroperitoneal space in both histologic types. The initial treatment appears to be important for the risk and localization of late relapses. The treatment of late relapses should be based on a representative presalvage biopsy and includes radical surgery and salvage chemotherapy in most cases. Five-year cancer-specific survival is above 50% in the recent large series and reaches 100% in case of single-site teratoma. Diagnosis and treatment of late-relapsing MGCT patients is challenging and should be performed in experienced centers only. Referral of late-relapsing patients to high-volume institutions ensures the best chances of cure and enables increasing understanding of tumor biology and the clinical course of these patients."

Using an intronic (CA)n polymorphic microsatellite marker within the IFN-gamma receptor-1 (IFNGR1) gene, we have compared the allelic frequencies of this marker in hospitalized tuberculosis patients (n = 120) with that of controls (n = 87) from Rijeka, Croatia. We identified 13 (CA)n alleles in the tuberculosis patients, whereas only 10 were found in the controls. A significant difference between one allelic marker and the control group was observed (P = 0.02, 95% confidence interval 0.14-0.94), suggesting a possible protective association. In contrast, several other allelic markers showed a trend towards association with the disease. We also found a trend towards an increased frequency in homozygosity of one allelic marker in patients (11.7%) as compared with controls (4.6%). We conclude that there is no evidence for disease association of the IFNGR1 gene marker in Mendelian-type (single-allele) inheritance. However, our results also suggest that unidentified allelic variations in the IFNGR1 gene might elevate or decrease the risk in this ethnic population, as a part of the multigenic predisposition to tuberculosis."
303,Is Ambient Light during the High Arctic Polar Night Sufficient to Act as a Visual Cue for Zooplankton?,26039111,PloS one. Volume: 10 Issue: 6 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26039111/,"The light regime is an ecologically important factor in pelagic habitats, influencing a range of biological processes. However, the availability and importance of light to these processes in high Arctic zooplankton communities during periods of 'complete' darkness (polar night) are poorly studied. Here we characterized the ambient light regime throughout the diel cycle during the high Arctic polar night, and ask whether visual systems of Arctic zooplankton can detect the low levels of irradiance available at this time. To this end, light measurements with a purpose-built irradiance sensor and coupled all-sky digital photographs were used to characterize diel skylight irradiance patterns over 24 hours at 79°N in January 2014 and 2015. Subsequent skylight spectral irradiance and in-water optical property measurements were used to model the underwater light field as a function of depth, which was then weighted by the electrophysiologically determined visual spectral sensitivity of a dominant high Arctic zooplankter, Thysanoessa inermis. Irradiance in air ranged between 1-1.5 x 10-5 μmol photons m-2 s-1 (400-700 nm) in clear weather conditions at noon and with the moon below the horizon, hence values reflect only solar illumination. Radiative transfer modelling generated underwater light fields with peak transmission at blue-green wavelengths, with a 465 nm transmission maximum in shallow water shifting to 485 nm with depth. To the eye of a zooplankter, light from the surface to 75 m exhibits a maximum at 485 nm, with longer wavelengths (>600 nm) being of little visual significance. Our data are the first quantitative characterisation, including absolute intensities, spectral composition and photoperiod of biologically relevant solar ambient light in the high Arctic during the polar night, and indicate that some species of Arctic zooplankton are able to detect and utilize ambient light down to 20-30m depth during the Arctic polar night.

A phantom, containing a fixed ring applicator set and six lead pellets representing dose points, was used. The phantom was CT scanned with the ring applicator at four different angles related to the image plane. In each scan the applicator was reconstructed by three methods: (1) direct reconstruction in each image (DR), (2) reconstruction in multiplanar reconstructed images (MPR) and (3) library plans, using pre-defined applicator geometry (LIB). The doses to the lead pellets were calculated. The relative standard deviation (SD) for all reconstruction methods was less than 3.7% in the dose points. The relative SD for the LIB method was significantly lower (p < 0.05) than for the DR and MPR methods for all but two points. All applicator orientations had similar dose calculation reproducibility. Using library plans for applicator reconstruction gives the most reproducible dose calculation. However, with restrictive guidelines for applicator reconstruction the uncertainties for all methods are low compared to other factors influencing the accuracy of brachytherapy."

Sixteen participants from two cohorts were interviewed in-depth. The interviews were analyzed applying a hermeneutic-phenomenological analysis. The participants struggled to gain access to follow-up health services. They felt that whether they were systematically followed up was more coincidental than planned. Young and midlife stroke survivors thus appear vulnerable to falling outside the follow-up system. Those participants who received some follow-up care perceived it as untailored to their specific needs. To be considered supportive, the follow-up programs must be in line with their long-term needs, take into account their particular challenges as young and midlife stroke survivors, and be planned in close collaboration with the individual patient. To secure systematic and follow-up health services tailored to the individual, knowledgeable and committed healthcare professionals should play a prominent role within the community health services.

Volume: 2 Issue: 4 Dec 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26061889/,"W. G. Cochran's Q statistic was introduced in 1937 to test for equality of means under heteroscedasticity. Today, the use of Q is widespread in tests for homogeneity of effects in meta-analysis, but often these effects (such as risk differences and odds ratios) are not normally distributed. It is common to assume that Q follows a chi-square distribution, but it has long been known that this asymptotic distribution for Q is not accurate for moderate sample sizes. In this paper, the effect and weight for an individual study may depend on two parameters: the effect and a nuisance parameter. We present expansions for the first two moments of Q without any normality assumptions. Our expansions will have wide applicability in testing for homogeneity in meta-analysis. As an important example, we present a homogeneity test when the effects are the differences of risks between treatment and control arms of the several studies-a test which is substantially more accurate than that currently used. In this situation, we approximate the distribution of Q with a gamma distribution. We provide the results of simulations to verify the accuracy of our proposal and an example of a meta-analysis of medical data. Copyright © 2012 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. "

The end points determined were the freely dissolved concentration (Cfree) using SPME, the potentially bioaccessible fraction (FXAD, %) and the distribution of p,p'-DDE among fast, moderate, and slow desorbing soil sites determined by three sequentially stronger SFE conditions. Cfree and FXAD decreased during the first 35 days of aging by up to 40%. After this, no significant changes were observed up to the end of the aging experiment. The relative percentage of fast desorbing sites tended to exponentially decrease with aging, while the percentage of moderate and slow desorbing sites increased over time. These changes were most apparent within the first 90 days of aging, after which the relative distribution of p,p'-DDE among desorbing sites remained relatively constant. Significant correlations between SFE and XAD results demonstrated that the XAD method preferentially desorbed p,p'-DDE from fast and moderate desorbing sites and is capable of extracting the bioaccessible fraction. The distribution among desorbing sites, Cfree and FXAD values determined after different periods of laboratory aging were then compared to those measured for a field-contaminated soil where p,p'-DDE had resided for more than 40 years. Cfree, FXAD and SFE profiles measured for the field-aged p,p'-DDE were similar to those observed for p,p'-DDE aged in laboratory for between 35 and 90 days. These results suggest that aging in the laboratory must be carried out for periods of months if it is to approximate field aging."

Sep 21 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30242533/,"Group-living animals rely on efficient transmission of information for optimal exploitation of their habitat. How efficient and resilient a network is depend on its structure, which is a consequence of the social interactions of the individuals that comprise the network. In macaques, network structure differs according to dominance style. Networks of intolerant species are more modular, more centralized, and less connected than those of tolerant ones. Given these structural differences, networks of intolerant species are potentially more vulnerable to fragmentation and decreased information transmission when central individuals disappear. Here we studied network resilience and efficiency in artificial societies of macaques. The networks were produced with an individual-based model that has been shown to reproduce the structural features of networks of tolerant and intolerant macaques. To study network resilience, we deleted either central individuals or individuals at random and studied the effects of these deletions on network cohesiveness and efficiency. The deletion of central individuals had more negative effects than random deletions from the networks of both tolerant and intolerant artificial societies. Central individuals thus appeared to aid in the maintenance of network cohesiveness and efficiency. Further, the networks of both intolerant and tolerant societies appeared to be robust to the loss of individuals, as network fragmentation was never observed. Our results suggest that despite differences in network structure, networks of tolerant and intolerant macaques may be equally resilient."

Individuals displaying arc-shaped bone lesions adjacent to greater than or equal to 2 first molars were diagnosed as juvenile periodontitis (JP) patients, while those with greater than or equal to 1 first molars showing vertical lesions were regarded as periodontal risk subjects. Teenagers with greater than or equal to 2 first molars exhibiting longitudinal bone loss were defined as high-risk patients. At the ages of 13 and 16 years, 3 (1.3%) and 4 (1.8%) subjects had JP, while 12 (5.4%) and 28 (12.6%) were regarded as periodontal risks; 8 (3.6%) subjects were assigned to the high-risk group; 4 (1.8%) 13-year olds had greater than or equal to 1 first molars missing; hence, no loss of posterior teeth occurred over a period of 3 years. Analyzing the data at the site-level revealed progressive loss and little fluctuation in the alveolar bone height in the high-risk group, and a more pronounced bone loss at the mesial than at the distal surfaces. Simpler data sets were constructed by aggregating some of the site-scores or by pooling these into subject-level scores.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

We aimed to differentiate between these functions and to identify differences between spontaneously hypertensive and normotensive rats. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists with different subtype selectivity or the ability to cross the blood-brain barrier were used to demonstrate beta-adrenoceptor involvement in resting blood pressure and the response to tyramine-induced peripheral norepinephrine release. The centrally acting propranolol (beta(1+2[+3])), CGP20712A (beta(1)), ICI-118551 (beta(2)), and SR59230A (beta(3)), as well as peripherally restricted nadolol (beta(1+2)) and atenolol (beta(1)), were administered intravenously, separately, or in combinations. Blood pressure, cardiac output, heart rate, total peripheral vascular resistance, and plasma catecholamine concentrations were evaluated. beta-Adrenoceptor antagonists had little effect on cardiovascular baselines in normotensive rats. In hypertensive rats, antagonist-induced hypotension paralleled reductions in resistance, except for atenolol, which reduced cardiac output. The resistance reduction involved primarily neuronal catecholamine, central beta(1)-adrenoceptors, and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors. Tyramine induced a transient, prazosin-sensitive vascular resistance increase. Inhibition of nerve-activated, peripheral beta(1/3)-adrenoceptors enhanced this alpha(1)-adrenoceptor-dependent vasoconstriction in normotensive but not hypertensive rats. In hypertensive rats, return to baseline was eliminated after inhibition of the central beta(1)-adrenoceptor, epinephrine release (acute adrenalectomy), and peripheral beta(2/3)-adrenoceptors. Adrenalectomy eliminated beta-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation in hypertensive rats, and tyramine induced a prazosin-sensitive vasoconstriction, which was inhibited by combined blockade of central beta(1)- and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors. In conclusion, nerve-activated beta(1)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation was not present in hypertensive rats, whereas epinephrine-activated beta(2)- and beta(3)-adrenoceptor-mediated vasodilation was upregulated. There was also a hypertensive, nerve-activated vasoconstrictory mechanism present in hypertensive rats, involving central beta(1)- and peripheral beta(2)-adrenoceptors combined."

We assessed experimentally whether dislodged lice return to their original host species. Adult lice from wild lumpfish and saithe were presented to lumpfish, sea trout, Atlantic cod, saithe and European plaice. All fish species became infected. Lumpfish and cod were strongly preferred, followed by saithe, trout and plaice. Lice from wild saithe showed a preference for saithe and lumpfish, followed by cod, sea trout and plaice. The mtCO1 gene was used to determine the genotypes of the lice. Lice from lumpfish were genotype 1. Lice from saithe were mainly genotype 2. The two genotypes of C. elongatus differed slightly in their host preferences: lice from saithe were less discriminating. The data support the hypothesis that adult C. elongatus may transfer between different host species. Cod is an attractive host for lice from both lumpfish and saithe, which suggests that C. elongatus may become a serious pest of farmed cod."

Volume: 363 Issue: 1 Apr 01 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17288981/,"The determination of kinetic parameters of chitinases using natural substrates is difficult due to low K(m) values, which require the use of low substrate concentrations that are hard to measure. Using the natural substrate (GlcNAc)(4), we have developed an assay for the determination of k(cat) and K(m)values of chitinases. Product concentrations as low as 0.5 microM were detected using normal-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) with an amide 80 column (0.20 x 25 cm) using spectrophotometric detection at 210 nm. By means of this assay, k(cat) and K(m)values for chitinases A (ChiA) and B (ChiB) of Serratia marcescens were found to be 33+/-1s(-1) and 9+/-1 microM and 28+/-2s(-1) and 4+/-2 microM, respectively. For ChiB, these values were compared to those found with commonly used substrates where the leaving group is a (nonnatural) chromophore, revealing considerable differences. For example, assays with 4-methylumbelliferyl-(GlcNAc)(2) yielded a k(cat) value of 18+/-2s(-1) and a K(m) value of 30+/-6 microM. For two ChiB mutants containing a Trp --> Ala mutation in the +1 or +2 subsites, the natural substrate and the 4-methylumbelliferyl-(GlcNAc)(2) assays yielded rather similar K(m) values (5-fold difference at most) but showed dramatic differences in k(cat) values (up to 90-fold). These results illustrate the risk of using artificial substrates for characterization of chitinases and, thus, show that the new HPLC-based assay is a valuable tool for future chitinase research."
315,Gender-dependent and genotype-sensitive monoaminergic changes induced by polychlorinated biphenyl 153 in the rat brain.,26215117,Neurotoxicology. Volume: 50 Sep 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26215117/,"Polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) are present as ortho- and non-ortho-substituted PCBs, with most of the ortho-substituted congeners being neurotoxic. The present study examined effects of the ortho-substituted PCB 153 on dopamine, serotonin and amino acid neurotransmitters in the neostriatum of both male and female Wistar Kyoto (WKY) and spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) genotypes. PCB 153 exposure at p8, p14 and p20 had no effects on levels of these transmitters when examined at p55, but led to increased levels of both homovanillic acid and 5-hydroxyindoleacetic acid, the degradation products of dopamine and serotonin, respectively, in all groups except the female SHR. Immunoblotting showed that PCB exposure induced gender-specific decreases in dopaminergic synaptic proteins. These included a novel finding of decreased levels of the dopamine D5 receptor in both genders and genotypes, whereas male-specific changes included decreases in the postsynaptic density (PSD)-95 protein in the WKY and SHRs and a decrease in the presynaptic dopamine transporter in both the WKY and, less clearly in the male SHR. A female-specific tendency of increased vesicular monoamine transporter-2 was observed in the SHRs after PCB exposure. No changes were seen in tyrosine hydroxylase, the cytoskeletal neurotubulin or the plasma membrane marker Na(+)/K(+)-ATPase in any strain. Hence, PCB-exposure led to increases in monoamine transmitter turnover in both male and female animals, whereas decreases in both pre- and postsynaptic dopaminergic proteins were predominantly seen in male animals. PCB 153 may therefore induce neostriatal toxicity through both presynaptic and postsynaptic mechanisms in both genotypes and genders, including effects on the aspiny interneurons, which employ the D5 receptor to mediate dopamine effects on interneurons in the basal ganglia.

Cumulative gastric urease activity (CA) was determined during the first 30 min after oral administration of 14C-urea (92.5 kBq) in 56 random volunteers and 49 consecutive patients with peptic ulcer disease. The distribution of CA in random volunteers was positively skewed. Logarithmic transformation yielded two separate populations, each normally distributed. Their normal probability density functions intercepted at log cutoff value. A bimodal distribution of log CA was confirmed in patients with peptic ulcer disease before and after treatment aimed at H. pylori eradication. Cutoff values were determined for both random volunteers and patients with peptic ulcer disease. By application of the present procedure for determination of cutoff value, the 14C-urea breath test distinguishes between individuals who have an increased gastric urease activity and individuals who do not, with the smallest possible arbitrariness."

The impact of warmer temperatures and the resulting changes to earth system processes on chemical fate are, however, unclear, although there are a growing number of studies that are beginning to examine these impacts and changes in a quantitative way. In this review, we examine broad areas where changes are occurring or are likely to occur with regard to the environmental cycling and fate of chemical contaminants. For this purpose we are examining scientific information from long-term monitoring data with particular emphasis on the Arctic, to show apparent changes in chemical patterns and behaviour. In addition, we examine evidence of changing chemical processes for a number of environmental compartments and indirect effects of climate change on contaminant emissions and behaviour. We also recommend areas of research to address knowledge gaps. In general, our findings indicate that the indirect consequences of climate change (i.e. shifts in agriculture, resource exploitation opportunities, etc.) will have a more marked impact on contaminants distribution and fate than direct climate change."

Volume: 285 Issue: 1870 01 10 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29321292/,"Life-history traits such as spawning migrations and timing of reproduction are adaptations to specific environmental constraints and seasonal cycles in many organisms' annual routines. In this study we analyse how offspring fitness constrains spawning phenology in a large migratory apex predator, the Atlantic bluefin tuna. The reproductive schedule of Atlantic bluefin tuna varies between spawning sites, suggesting plasticity to local environmental conditions. Generally, temperature is considered to be the main constraint on tuna spawning phenology. We combine evidence from long-term field data, temperature-controlled rearing experiments on eggs and larvae, and a model of egg fitness, and show that Atlantic bluefin tuna do not spawn to optimize egg and larval temperature exposure. The timing of spawning leads to temperature exposure considerably lower than optimal at all spawning grounds across the Atlantic Ocean. The early spawning is constrained by thermal inhibition of egg hatching and larval growth rates, but some other factors must prevent later spawning. Matching offspring with ocean productivity and the prey peak might be an important driver for bluefin tuna spawning phenology. This finding is important for predictions of reproductive timing in future climate warming scenarios for bluefin tuna."

So far, five genotype groups of this pathogen have been identified by applying random amplified polymorphic DNA analysis on axenic cultures. To allow genotyping of A. astaci in host tissue samples, we have developed co-dominant microsatellite markers for this pathogen, tested them on pure cultures of all genotype groups, and subsequently evaluated their use on tissues of (1) natural A. astaci carriers, i.e., North American crayfish species, and (2) A. astaci-infected indigenous European species from crayfish plague outbreaks. Out of over 200 potential loci containing simple sequence repeat (SSR) motifs identified by 454 pyrosequencing of SSR-enriched library, we tested 25 loci with highest number of repeats, and finally selected nine that allow unambiguous separation of all known RAPD-defined genotype groups of A. astaci from axenic cultures. Using these markers, we were able to characterize A. astaci strains from DNA isolates from infected crayfish tissues when crayfish had a moderate to high agent level according to quantitative PCR analyses. The results support the hypothesis that different North American crayfish hosts carry different genotype groups of the pathogen, and confirm that multiple genotype groups, including the one originally introduced to Europe in the 19th century, cause crayfish plague outbreaks in Central Europe. So far undocumented A. astaci genotype seems to have caused one of the analysed outbreaks from the Czech Republic. The newly developed culture-independent approach allowing direct genotyping of this pathogen in both axenic cultures and mixed genome samples opens new possibilities in studies of crayfish plague pathogen distribution, diversity and epidemiology."

The protein has been characterized and compared with the closely related homologous iron superoxide dismutase from the mesophilic Escherichia coli (ecFeSOD) in an attempt to rationalize its environmental adaptation. ecFeSOD shares 75% identity with asFeSOD. Compared with the mesophilic FeSOD, the psychrophilic FeSOD has distinct temperature differences in residual activity and thermostability that do not seem to be related to structural differences such as intramolecular or intermolecular ion bonds, hydrogen bonds or cavity sizes. However, an increased net negative charge on the surface of asFeSOD may explain its lower thermostability compared with ecFeSOD. Activity measurements and differential scanning calorimetry measurements revealed that the psychrophilic asFeSOD had a thermostability that was significantly higher than the optimal growth temperature of the host organism."

Case-control studies performed in 2001 in Norway and Sweden indicated that consumption of chicken was associated with illness. In 2002 and 2003, continuing case reports indicated that this uncommon phage type had probably become established in the Greek food chain. Tour operators were informed and contacts were made with Greek public health authorities. Because place of infection is not systematically included in most Salmonella notification systems, the S. Enteritidis phage type 14b outbreak reported here may represent only part of a larger outbreak among travellers visiting Greece. Infections are often reported only in the tourists' home countries and public health authorities in the tourist destinations may not be aware of the problem. Further collaboration between national institutes of public health in Europe is needed to detect outbreaks occurring among tourists."

French and German were taken as comparative languages, taking into account the male gender bias associated to both languages, as well as the comparative gender biases associated to their plural determiners (French: les [generic] vs. German: die [morphologically feminine]). Bilingual speakers of French and German had to judge whether a pair of facial images representing two men or a man and a woman could represent a gender stereotypical role noun prime (e.g., nurses). The prime was presented in the masculine plural form with or without a plural determiner. Results indicated that the overt grammaticization of the male gender in the masculine form dominated the representation of the role nouns (though interpretable as generic). However, the effect of the determiner was not found, indicating that only gender information associated to a human reference role noun had impacted readers' representations. The results, discussed in the framework of the thinking-for-speaking hypothesis, demonstrated that linguistic-visual paradigms are well-suited to gauge the impact of both stereotype information and grammaticization when processing role nouns.

Resveratrol (RESV) is a lipid-soluble phytoalexin present in fruits and vegetables with proven in vivo antioxidant function in animals. The present study aims to assess the potential use of RESV in Atlantic salmon feeds. To this end, post-smolt salmons with an initial BW of 148±3 g were fed four experimental diets for 15 weeks. A diet low in fish oil served as a control and was supplemented with 0, 0.5, 1.5 and 2.5 g/kg of RESV, respectively. The effect of the experimental diets on animal performance, tissue fatty acid composition, and the expression of genes encoding proteins involved in antioxidant signalling, lipid peroxidation, and metabolism were studied. Resveratrol significantly reduced feed intake and final BW of the salmon. Feeding RESV did not affect the sum of saturated and monounsaturated fatty acids or total lipids in the fillet. While the content of total polyunsaturated fatty acids was not affected, the percentages of some fatty acids in the liver and fillet were changed by RESV. Furthermore, in liver, the relative expression of glutathione peroxidase 4b, nuclear factor-like 2, and arachidonate 5-lipoxygenase remained unchanged across treatment groups. In conclusion, the negative impact of dietary RESV on FI and hence reduction of the BW discourages its inclusion in low fish oil diets for Atlantic salmon."

Lower rCBF for patients than controls were seen in the left frontal, temporal, parietal, and occipital cortices. The higher retroplenial rCBF in patients than controls may reflect increased attention towards sub-noxious somatosensory signaling, and agrees with the notion that fibromyalgic pain reflects secondary hyperalgesia. The brain regions with lower rCBF in fibromyalgic patients than controls participate in the normal cognitive processing of pain, which may be dysfunctional in fibromyalgia."

The β-glucan specific yield, however, increased with the use of chitosan and guar gum, which were able to remove protein and ash impurities resulting in gums with a higher purity.The highest concentration of chitosan (0.6 %) resulted in gums with the highest β-glucan content (82.0 ± 0.23 and 79.0 ± 0.19 for barley and oat, respectively) and highest β-glucan specific yield (96.9 and 93.3 % for oat and barley, respectively). Explanation is in R&D section. The use of gelatin was not successful. All gum samples had a high content of total dietary fiber (>74%) and a high water holding capacity (4.6-7.4 g/g), but differed in apparent viscosity, which was highest for the oat sample extracted with 0.6% chitosan. This sample also showed the highest β-glucan molecular weight among the oat samples, which were in general 10-fold higher than for the barley samples. Among the barley samples, β-glucan molecular weight was highest for the control."

Volume: 20 Issue: 2 Feb 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468824/,"Converging evidence implicates immune abnormalities in schizophrenia (SCZ), and recent genome-wide association studies (GWAS) have identified immune-related single-nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) associated with SCZ. Using the conditional false discovery rate (FDR) approach, we evaluated pleiotropy in SNPs associated with SCZ (n=21,856) and multiple sclerosis (MS) (n=43,879), an inflammatory, demyelinating disease of the central nervous system. Because SCZ and bipolar disorder (BD) show substantial clinical and genetic overlap, we also investigated pleiotropy between BD (n=16,731) and MS. We found significant genetic overlap between SCZ and MS and identified 21 independent loci associated with SCZ, conditioned on association with MS. This enrichment was driven by the major histocompatibility complex (MHC). Importantly, we detected the involvement of the same human leukocyte antigen (HLA) alleles in both SCZ and MS, but with an opposite directionality of effect of associated HLA alleles (that is, MS risk alleles were associated with decreased SCZ risk). In contrast, we found no genetic overlap between BD and MS. Considered together, our findings demonstrate genetic pleiotropy between SCZ and MS and suggest that the MHC signals may differentiate SCZ from BD susceptibility."

B, Analytical technologies in the biomedical and life sciences. Volume: 929 Jun 15 2013",2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23669612/,"NSE, neuron-specific enolase, is an important biomarker for several pathological conditions including small cell lung cancer (SCLC). The current paper presents an LC-MS/MS-based approach for quantification of NSE in serum at both reference levels and elevated levels. The analytical approach utilizes selective sample preparation by immunoextraction of all forms of NSE (αγ, γγ, and γ) followed by tryptic digestion, and separation and detection by LC-SRM-MS. The quantification of NSE is performed through a signature peptide specific for the γ-subunit of NSE (tryptic peptide γ16; ELPLYR). The method is validated and shows satisfactory results (linearity r(2)>0.999 (range 5-500ng/mL), intra-day precision <13% RSD, and accuracy >95%), and has a limit of quantification (of 38pg/mL; S/N=10) significantly lower than endogenous levels of healthy subjects. In addition, the method simultaneously allows determination of the αγ-heterodimer through a signature peptide specific for the α-subunit (tryptic peptide α12; TIAPALVSK). The method was successfully applied to serum samples from healthy blood donors. In all samples from healthy blood donors both the α- and the γ-subunit was detected (S/N>200 for both signature peptides), confirming the presence of the αγ-heterodimer in these sample. The level in one of them was determined to be (n=5) 7.3±0.45ng/mL of γ-subunit of NSE."

Volume: 8 Aug 07 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23930987/,"The use of digital portable music devices such as MP3 players has rapidly increased during the last decade, and the sheer availability of music offered by such players raises questions about their impact on listeners' mental and physical health and well-being. This article explores MP3 player use as an everyday tactic for affect regulation, here understood as an individual's efforts to maintain or change the intensity or duration of a given affect. The ability to understand and regulate affects has significant health implications, and among the tactics relevant to such regulation, engagement with music has proven to be particularly successful. The material presented in this article is based on a qualitative interview study focused on MP3 player use as a medium for musical self-care. Because MP3 users can listen to whatever they want, whenever they want, and target their music in the interests of managing and regulating moods and emotions, the MP3 player represents a valuable and convenient technology of affect regulation.

Volume: 20 Issue: 12 Dec 2018",2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29533164/,"Child sexual abuse (CSA) is a major global health concern. Although it is prevalent in Kenya, scant literature on factors contributing to CSA vulnerability exists. Using qualitative data from 28 focus groups and ethnographic field notes, we explored and assessed community perceptions of factors contributing to CSA vulnerability in Homa Bay County, Western Kenya. Findings suggest that people living in these communities perceived CSA as being influenced by multiple factors: developmental stage, peer pressure, huge gender disparities exacerbated by negative social norms and cultural practices, the HIV epidemic and social media platforms that circulate sexualised images. From our findings, it was clear that participants also regarded poverty as exacerbating children's vulnerability to CSA. Minors from poor families engaged in transactional sex for survival and social status. Some community members perceived girls dressed in short skirts or tight clothing as warranting unwanted sexual advances. Although poverty and gender roles and relations were viewed as increasing vulnerability to CSA, blame was often placed on survivors' modes of dress or behaviour. There is a need for comprehensive education of the communities on CSA, its consequences and the rights of women and girls."

This paper reports on the Scandinavian portion of the study. 6,354 women were referred to the study and 5,722 women, who were expecting their second or third child between January 1986 and March 1988, were eligible and made their first appointment for the study. Of these, 1,945 women and their births were selected for follow-up at four prenatal visits, delivery, and during the first year of life. This report analyzes the relative impact of various maternal pre-pregnancy risk factors associated with SGA birth. For example, mothers who smoked cigarettes around the time of conception, but who had none of the other major risk factors, nearly doubled their risk of SGA birth. A previous low birth weight (LBW) delivery increased the risk nearly two and a half times among non-smokers. If a mother both smoked and had a previous LBW, the relative risk rose to nearly five and a half. Low maternal pre-pregnancy weight (< 50 kg) increased the risk of SGA birth almost twofold among non-smokers, while low pre-pregnancy weight and smoking together increased the risk of SGA birth fourfold. A low weight mother who smoked and also had a previous LBW delivery, had a risk of SGA birth that was nearly six times that of a mother without those characteristics."

Volume: 115 Issue: 9 Aug 28 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26371655/,"Wave scattering provides profound insight into the structure of matter. Typically, the ability to sense microstructure is determined by the ratio of scatterer size to probing wavelength. Here, we address the question of whether macroscopic waves can report back the presence and distribution of microscopic scatterers despite several orders of magnitude difference in scale between wavelength and scatterer size. In our analysis, monosized hard scatterers 5  μm in radius are immersed in lossless gelatin phantoms to investigate the effect of multiple reflections on the propagation of shear waves with millimeter wavelength. Steady-state monochromatic waves are imaged in situ via magnetic resonance imaging, enabling quantification of the phase velocity at a voxel size big enough to contain thousands of individual scatterers, but small enough to resolve the wavelength. We show in theory, experiments, and simulations that the resulting coherent superposition of multiple reflections gives rise to power-law dispersion at the macroscopic scale if the scatterer distribution exhibits apparent fractality over an effective length scale that is comparable to the probing wavelength. Since apparent fractality is naturally present in any random medium, microstructure can thereby leave its fingerprint on the macroscopically quantifiable power-law exponent. Our results are generic to wave phenomena and carry great potential for sensing microstructure that exhibits intrinsic fractality, such as, for instance, vasculature."

Volume: 114 Issue: Pt 12 Jun 2001,2001,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11493665/,"Hrs, an essential tyrosine kinase substrate, has been implicated in intracellular trafficking and signal transduction pathways. The protein contains several distinctive domains, including an N-terminal VHS domain, a phosphatidylinositol 3-phosphate (PtdIns(3)P)-binding FYVE domain and two coiled-coil domains. Here we have investigated the roles of these domains in the subcellular localisation of Hrs. Hrs was found to colocalise extensively with EEA1, an established marker of early endosomes. While the membrane association of EEA1 was abolished in the presence of a dominant negative mutant of the endosomal GTPase Rab5, the localisation of Hrs to early endosomes was Rab5 independent. The VHS-domain was nonessential for the subcellular targeting of Hrs. In contrast, the FYVE domain as well as the second coiled-coil domain, which has been shown to bind to SNAP-25, were required for targeting of Hrs to early endosomes. A small construct consisting of only these two domains was correctly localised to early endosomes, whereas a point mutation (R183A) in the PtdIns(3)P-binding pocket of the FYVE domain inhibited the membrane targeting of Hrs. Thus, like EEA1, the endosomal targeting of Hrs is mediated by a PtdIns(3)P-binding FYVE domain in cooperation with an additional domain. We speculate that binding to PtdIns(3)P and a SNAP-25-related molecule may target Hrs specifically to early endosomes."

In particular, cycling to work or to school can be a relatively high intensity activity that by itself might suffice for maximum health gain. In this paper, we present estimates of net health effects that can be assumed for demand responses to infrastructure development. The estimation was based on comparing current cyclists/pedestrians against potential cyclists/pedestrians, applying the international physical activity questionnaire, which is a survey-based method for estimating metabolic equivalent task levels from self-reported types of physical activity, and their frequency, duration and level of intensity (moderate or vigorous).. By comparing between shares of individuals with medium or high intensity levels, within the segments of current cyclists/pedestrians and potential cyclists/pedestrians, we estimate the possible net health effects of potential new users of improved cycling/walking infrastructure. For an underpinning of the estimates, we also include the respondents' assessments of the extent to which cycling/walking for transport replaces other physical activity, and we carry out a regression of cycling/walking activity levels on individual characteristics and cycle/walk facility features."

Volume: 158 2001,2001,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11092032/,"The presence of circulating tumor cells in bone marrow and peripheral blood of cancer patients may reflect the aggressiveness of the disease. This also applies to cancers that rarely give rise to overt bone marrow metastases. The clinical validity of micrometastasis detection for staging and prognostication depends on the sensitivity and reliability of the detection method. In malignant melanoma, most studies have used reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) techniques, commonly with tyrosinase mRNA as the target molecule. Unfortunately, highly inconsistent results have been reported, raising doubts about this approach. In a study of 81 melanoma patients with metastatic disease, we used an immunobead rosetting method in which live melanoma cells are selected and identified by binding of paramagnetic beads coated with the 9.2.27 antibody against the high molecular weight melanoma-associated antigen. In bone marrow samples obtained from 60 patients, 14 (23.3%) were positive, compared to only two of 81 in blood. A highly significant correlation (p = 0.0001, log rank test) was found between micrometastasis positivity and overall survival from time of removal of the primary tumor. Moreover, in regression analysis it was found that the presence of micrometastatic cells was an independent and the most important indicator of poor prognosis, with a relative risk of 5.38. The immunomagnetic method is simple, rapid, and highly sensitive and will be used in further prospective clinical studies."

In total, 8984 (88%) out of 10 202 invited adolescents aged 12-19 years participated in the youth part of the Nord-Trøndelag Health Study [Helseundersøkelsen i Nord-Trøndelag (HUNT)]. The total study population in this study consisted of 8255 individuals after exclusion of invalid questionnaires and students outside the target range of 13-18 years of age. The students completed a comprehensive questionnaire, and one of the questions was whether the students had experienced any headaches during the last 12 months. In addition, 5847 of these students were also subject to an interview in which they were asked whether they had experienced recurring headaches during the last year and, if so, were they classified as migraine (MI), tension-type headache (TTH) or non-classifiable headache. In the total questionnaire-based population, 76.8% reported having had headaches during the last 12 months (69.4% boys and 84.2% girls). Among those who also were interviewed, 29.1% reported having recurrent headaches (21.0% boys and 36.5% girls). The overall 1-year prevalence of migraine was 7%, of tension-type headache 18%, and of non-classifiable headache 4.8%. Higher prevalence rates were found for girls in all age groups and for all headache categories. The overall frequency of recurrent headaches did not vary significantly with age, but girls had significantly more frequent headaches than boys. We concluded that headache in general, and recurrent primary headache disorders like migraine and tension-type headaches, are common somatic complaints among Norwegian adolescents, especially among girls."

A systematic search was performed in several medical databases and 601 articles were screened for relevance. Nine articles were deemed eligible for in-depth analysis using a standardized data collection form by two independent researchers. Proton treatment plans compared favorably to photon-plans regarding dose to uninvolved neural tissue. Fatigue (27-100%), alopecia (37-85%), local erythema (78-85%) and headache (27-75%) were among the most common acute toxicities. One study reported no significant long-term cognitive impairments. Limited data was available on long-term survival. One study reported a 5-year overall survival of 84% and 5-year progression-free survival of 40%. We conclude that published data from clinical studies using proton therapy for adults with LGG are scarce. As the technique becomes more available, controlled clinical studies are urgently warranted to determine if the potential benefits based on comparative treatment planning translate into clinical benefits."

We assessed muscle force-generating capacity, evoked potentials recordings (V-wave and H-reflex normalized to M-wave; V/M-ratio and H/M-ratio) and voluntary activation (VA) in the plantar flexors of the contralateral limb following unilateral maximal strength training (MST) with the dominant limb for 3 weeks (nine sessions). Twenty-three 73 ± 4(SD) year old males were randomized to a MST group (N = 11), exercising with an intensity of ~90% of maximal strength, or a control group (CG, N = 12). MST improved contralateral maximal strength (107.6 ± 27.0 to 119.1 ± 34.8 Nm; 10%) and rate of force development (197.3 ± 54.1 to 232.8 ± 77.7 Nm s-1; 18%) (both p < .05). These strength gains were associated with (r = 0.465-0.608) an enhanced soleus V/M-ratio (0.12 ± 0.09 to 0.21 ± 0.17) and VA (79.5 ± 5.1 to 83.3 ± 5.2%) (all p < .05). H/M-ratio (10% maximal strength) remained unaltered after MST, and no changes were apparent in the CG. In conclusion, cross-limb effects in older adults are regulated by efferent neural drive enhancement, and advocate the clinical relevance of MST to improve neuromuscular function in individuals with conditions that results in unilateral strength reductions."

Various adaptation strategies have been investigated for the enrichment of suitable and stable MMC, trying to overcome inhibition problems and enhance substrate degradation efficiency, as well as generation of soluble fermentation products. Repeated transfers in small batches and fed-batch conditions have been applied, comparing the use of different inoculum, growth media, and Kinetic Control. The adaptation of activated sludge inoculum was performed successfully and continued unhindered for several months. The best results showed a substrate degradation efficiency of almost 100% (about 10 g/L glycerol in 21 h) and different dominant metabolic products were obtained, depending on the selection strategy (mainly 1,3-propanediol, ethanol, or butyrate). On the other hand, anaerobic sludge exhibited inactivation after a few transfers. To circumvent this problem, fed-batch mode was used as an alternative adaptation strategy, which led to effective substrate degradation and high 1,3-propanediol and butyrate production. Changes in microbial composition were monitored by means of Next Generation Sequencing, revealing a dominance of glycerol consuming species, such as Clostridium, Klebsiella, and Escherichia."

This type of radiation is of particular interest due to the lack of research in this field and how it impacts population health. In order to understand the possible health effects of nuclear bomb testing, it is important to determine what studies have been conducted on the effects of low dose exposure and dosimetry, and evaluate new epidemiologic data and biological material collected from populations living in proximity to the test site. With time, new epidemiological data has been made available, and it is possible that these data may be linked to biological samples. Next to linking existing and newly available data to examine health effects, the existing dosimetry system needs to be expanded and further developed to include residential areas, which have not yet been taken into account. The aim of this paper is to provide an overview of previous studies evaluating the health effects of nuclear testing, including some information on dosimetry efforts, and pointing out directions for future epidemiologic studies."

This systematic review is of high methodological quality. Nevertheless, the exclusion of studies with nonrandomized designs and the inclusion of large studies of weak interventions might have resulted in an underestimation of the effect of PFMT. The dose-response relationship is important in PFMT, and intensive training with close follow-up is required to achieve beneficial effects."

Volume: 34 Issue: 33 Aug 13 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25122891/,"Dendritic NMDA spike/plateau potentials, first discovered in cortical pyramidal neurons, provide supralinear integration of synaptic inputs on thin and distal dendrites, thereby increasing the impact of these inputs on the soma. The more specific functional role of these potentials has been difficult to clarify, partly due to the complex circuitry of cortical neurons. Thalamocortical (TC) neurons in the dorsal lateral geniculate nucleus participate in simpler circuits. They receive their primary afferent input from retina and send their output to visual cortex. Cortex, in turn, regulates this output through massive feedback to distal dendrites of the TC neurons. The TC neurons can operate in two modes related to behavioral states: burst mode prevailing during sleep, when T-type calcium bursts largely disrupt the transfer of signals from retina to cortex, and tonic mode, which provides reliable transfer of retinal signals to cortex during wakefulness. We studied dendritic potentials in TC neurons with combined two-photon calcium imaging and whole-cell recording of responses to local dendritic glutamate iontophoresis in acute brain slices from mice. We found that NMDA spike/plateaus can be elicited locally at distal dendrites of TC neurons. We suggest that these dendritic potentials have important functions in the cortical regulation of thalamocortical transmission. NMDA spike/plateaus can induce shifts in the functional mode from burst to tonic by blockade of T-type calcium conductances. Moreover, in tonic mode, they can facilitate the transfer of retinal signals to cortex by depolarization of TC neurons. "

PCM fibres with melting temperatures of 28.4 and 32.0°C and PCM packs with melting temperatures of 28.0 and 32.0°C were studied. The results showed that the PCM fibres had a larger initial peak cooling effect than that of the PCM packs. The duration of the cooling effect of PCM fibres was primarily dependent on the PCM mass and the latent heat of fusion capacity, and secondly on the covered area and melting temperature of the PCM."

To evaluate the proposed behavioural dimensions, relationships with individual beliefs and socio-economic factors were explored. A simple random sample of 1190 residents born in 1972 was drawn from the populations of three counties in western Norway in February 1997. A questionnaire was mailed to the eligible sample. After one reminder, 735 subjects (58% women) replied. Principal component analysis (PCA) provided two factors, which accounted for 32.5% of the variance among the behavioural variables. One-way analysis of variance revealed significant, inverse relationships between two sum scores of health enhancing and health detrimental behaviour derived from the factors; socioeconomic variables and perceived vulnerability. Controlling for gender, multiple logistic regression analyses revealed significant relationships between health enhancing behaviour and occupational status (non-manual versus student, OR=0.6, 95% CI 0.4-0.8) and perceived vulnerability (OR=2.2, 95% CI 1.5-3.0). Occupational status (manual versus student OR=1.8 95% CI 1.2-2.6 and non-manual versus student OR=1.4 95% CI 1.0-2.1) turned out to be the strongest predictor of health detrimental behaviour. The present results indicate that oral and general health behaviour reflects two distinct behavioural domains. This appears to imply that oral and general health behaviour should be approached jointly in health promotion lifestyle programmes and that the lower socio-economic status groups should be targeted."

Volume: 3 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27446930/,"Vitamin B12 (cobalamin, Cbl, B12) is an indispensable water-soluble micronutrient that serves as a coenzyme for cytosolic methionine synthase (MS) and mitochondrial methylmalonyl-CoA mutase (MCM). Deficiency of Cbl, whether nutritional or due to inborn errors of Cbl metabolism, inactivate MS and MCM leading to the accumulation of homocysteine (Hcy) and methylmalonic acid (MMA), respectively. In conjunction with total B12 and its bioactive protein-bound form, holo-transcobalamin (holo-TC), Hcy, and MMA are the preferred serum biomarkers utilized to determine B12 status. Clinically, vitamin B12 deficiency leads to neurological deterioration and megaloblastic anemia, and, if left untreated, to death. Subclinical vitamin B12 deficiency (usually defined as a total serum B12 of <200 pmol/L) presents asymptomatically or with rather subtle generic symptoms that oftentimes are mistakenly ascribed to unrelated disorders. Numerous studies have now established that serum vitamin B12 has limited diagnostic value as a stand-alone marker. Low serum levels of vitamin B12 not always represent deficiency, and likewise, severe functional deficiency of the micronutrient has been documented in the presence of normal and even high levels of serum vitamin B12. This review discusses the usefulness and limitations of current biomarkers of B12 status in newborn screening, infant and adult diagnostics, the algorithms utilized to diagnose B12 deficiency and unusual findings of vitamin B12 status in various human disorders.

Volume: 11 Issue: 6 Jun 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26047361/,"The bacterial replication cycle is driven by the DnaA protein which cycles between the active ATP-bound form and the inactive ADP-bound form. It has been suggested that DnaA also is the main controller of initiation frequency. Initiation is thought to occur when enough ATP-DnaA has accumulated. In this work we have performed cell cycle analysis of cells that contain a surplus of ATP-DnaA and asked whether initiation then occurs earlier. It does not. Cells with more than a 50% increase in the concentration of ATP-DnaA showed no changes in timing of replication. We suggest that although ATP-DnaA is the main actor in initiation of replication, its accumulation does not control the time of initiation. ATP-DnaA is the motor that drives the initiation process, but other factors will be required for the exact timing of initiation in response to the cell's environment. We also investigated the in vivo roles of datA dependent DnaA inactivation (DDAH) and the DnaA-binding protein DiaA. Loss of DDAH affected the cell cycle machinery only during slow growth and made it sensitive to the concentration of DiaA protein. The result indicates that compromised cell cycle machines perform in a less robust manner. "

In vitro engineering of articular cartilage using cells and biomaterials may prove to be the best solution. Patients with osteoarthritis (OA) may require tissue engineered cartilage therapy. Chondrocytes obtained from OA joints are thought to be involved in the disease process, and thus to be of insufficient quality to be used for repair strategies. Bone marrow (BM) derived mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs) from healthy donors may represent an alternative cell source. We have isolated chondrocytes from OA joints, performed cell culture expansion and tissue engineering of cartilage using a disc-shaped alginate scaffold and chondrogenic differentiation medium. We performed real-time reverse transcriptase quantitative PCR and fluorescence immunohistochemistry to evaluate mRNA and protein expression for a range of molecules involved in chondrogenesis and OA pathogenesis. Results were compared with those obtained by using BM-MSCs in an identical tissue engineering strategy. Finally the two populations were compared using genome-wide mRNA arrays. At three weeks of chondrogenic differentiation we found high and similar levels of hyaline cartilage-specific type II collagen and fibrocartilage-specific type I collagen mRNA and protein in discs containing OA and BM-MSC derived chondrocytes. Aggrecan, the dominant proteoglycan in hyaline cartilage, was more abundantly distributed in the OA chondrocyte extracellular matrix. OA chondrocytes expressed higher mRNA levels also of other hyaline extracellular matrix components. Surprisingly BM-MSC derived chondrocytes expressed higher mRNA levels of OA markers such as COL10A1, SSP1 (osteopontin), ALPL, BMP2, VEGFA, PTGES, IHH, and WNT genes, but lower levels of MMP3 and S100A4. Based on the results presented here, OA chondrocytes may be suitable for tissue engineering of articular cartilage."

Volume: 8 Issue: 1 02 06 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29410498/,"Testicular germ cell tumour (TGCT) is the most common cancer in young men in large parts of the world, but the aetiology is mainly unknown. Genome-wide association studies have so far identified about 50 susceptibility loci associated with TGCT, including SPRY4. SPRY4 has shown tumour suppressor activity in several cancer cells, such as lung and prostate, while it was found to act as an oncogene in ovarian cancer. An intronic region within the SPRY4 gene produces a long non-coding RNA, SPRY4-IT1, which has been reported to act as an oncogene in melanoma, breast cancer, and colorectal cancer, and as a tumour suppressor in lung cancer. The roles of SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 in TGCT development are yet unknown. We found higher expression levels of SPRY4, both mRNA and protein, and of SPRY4-IT1 in human TGCT than in normal adult testis. Small-interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated transient knockdown of SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 in two TGCT cell lines 833 K and NT2-D1 resulted in decreased cell growth, migration, and invasion. Knockdown of SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 also led to a significant reduction in the phosphorylation of Akt. Our findings indicate that SPRY4 and SPRY4-IT1 may act as oncogenes in TGCTs via activation of the PI3K / Akt signalling pathway."

Volume: 9 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29593765/,"Nearly half of the world cereal production comes from soils low or marginal in plant available zinc, leading to unsustainable and poor quality grain production. Therefore, the effects of nitrogen (N) rate and application time on zinc (Zn) and iron (Fe) concentration in wheat grain were investigated. Wheat (Triticum aestivum var. Krabat) was grown in a growth chamber with 8 and 16 h of day and night periods, respectively. The N rates were 29, 43, and 57 mg N kg-1 soil, equivalent to 80, 120, and 160 kg N ha-1. Zinc and Fe were applied at 10 mg kg-1 growth media. In one of the N treatments, additional Zn and Fe through foliar spray (6 mg of Zn or Fe in 10 ml water/pot) was applied. Micro-analytical localization of Zn and Fe within grain was performed using scanning macro-X-ray fluorescence (MA-XRF) and laser ablation-inductively coupled plasma-mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS). The following data were obtained: grain and straw yield pot-1, 1000 grains weight, number of grains pot-1, whole grain protein content, concentration of Zn and Fe in the grains. Grain yield increased from 80 to 120 kg N ha-1 rates only and decreased at 160 kg N ha-1 g. Relatively higher protein content and Zn and Fe concentration in the grain were recorded with the split N application of 160 kg N ha-1. Soil and foliar supply of Zn and Fe (Zn + Fes+f), with a single application of 120 kg N ha-1N at sowing, increased the concentration of Zn by 46% and of Fe by 35%, as compared to their growth media application only. Line scans of freshly cut areas of sliced grains showed co-localization of Zn and Fe within germ, crease and aleurone. We thus conclude that split application of N at 160 kg ha-1 at sowing and stem elongation, in combination with soil and foliar application of Zn and Fe, can be a good agricultural practice to enhance protein content and the Zn and Fe concentration in grain."

Volume: 523 Issue: 7561 Jul 23 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26176924/,"Grid cells in the medial entorhinal cortex have spatial firing fields that repeat periodically in a hexagonal pattern. When animals move, activity is translated between grid cells in accordance with the animal's displacement in the environment. For this translation to occur, grid cells must have continuous access to information about instantaneous running speed. However, a powerful entorhinal speed signal has not been identified. Here we show that running speed is represented in the firing rate of a ubiquitous but functionally dedicated population of entorhinal neurons distinct from other cell populations of the local circuit, such as grid, head-direction and border cells. These 'speed cells' are characterized by a context-invariant positive, linear response to running speed, and share with grid cells a prospective bias of ∼50-80 ms. Our observations point to speed cells as a key component of the dynamic representation of self-location in the medial entorhinal cortex. "

Volume: 63 Issue: 7 Jul 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21409442/,"Two clusters of rat Nkrp1 genes can be distinguished based on phylogenetic relationships and functional characteristics. The proximal (centromeric) cluster encodes the well-studied NKR-P1A and NKR-P1B receptors and the distal cluster, the largely uncharacterized, NKR-P1F and NKR-P1G receptors. The inhibitory NKR-P1G receptor is expressed only by the Ly49s3(+) NK cell subset as detected by RT-PCR, while the activating NKR-P1F receptor is detected in both Ly49s3(+) and NKR-P1B(+) NK cells. The mouse NKR-P1G ortholog is expressed by both NKR-P1D(-) and NKR-P1D(+) NK cells in C57BL/6 mice. The rat and mouse NKR-P1F and NKR-P1G receptors demonstrate a striking, cross-species conservation of specificity for Clr ligands. NKR-P1F and NKR-P1G reporter cells reacted with overlapping panels of tumour cell lines and with cells transiently transfected with rat Clr2, Clr3, Clr4, Clr6 and Clr7 and mouse Clrc, Clrf, Clrg and Clrd/x, but not with Clr11 or Clrb, which serve as ligands for NKR-P1 from the proximal cluster. These data suggest that the conserved NKR-P1F and NKR-P1G receptors function as promiscuous receptors for a rapidly evolving family of Clr ligands in rodent NK cells."

MNA contributes relatively more to prediction of late prognosis than tumour diameter and vice versa for early prognosis.

However, these established correlations are limited to high ice adhesion and become invalid when the ice adhesion strength is low. Here we carried out an experimental study to explore the relationships between low ice adhesion strength and room temperature surface properties. A variety of room temperature properties of 22 polymer-based hydrophilic and hydrophobic samples consisting of both low and high ice adhesion surfaces were analysed. The properties investigated include water adhesion force, water wettability, roughness, elastic modulus and hardness. Our results show that low ice adhesion strength does not correlate well with water contact angle and its variants, surface roughness and hardness. Low elastic modulus does not guarantee low ice adhesion, however, surfaces with low ice adhesion always show low elastic modulus. Low ice adhesion (below 60 kPa) of tested surfaces may be determinative of small water adhesion force (from 180 to 270 μN). Therefore, measurement of water adhesion force may provide an effective strategy for screening anti-icing or icephobic surfaces, and surfaces within specific values of water adhesion force will possibly lead to a low ice adhesion."
416,Technological paternalism: on how medicine has reformed ethics and how technology can refine moral theory.,12971295,Science and engineering ethics. Volume: 9 Issue: 3 Jul 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12971295/,"The objective of this article is to investigate ethical aspects of technology through the moral term ""paternalism"". The field of investigation is medicine. The reason for this is twofold. Firstly, ""paternalism"" has gained moral relevance through modern medicine, where physicians have been accused of behaving paternalistic and threatening patients' autonomy. Secondly, medicine is a brilliant area to scrutinise the evaluative aspects of technology. It is argued that paternalism is a morally relevant term for the ethics of technology, but that its traditional conception is not adequate to address the challenges of modern technology. A modification towards a ""technological paternalism"" is necessary. That is, ""technological paternalism"" is a fruitful term in the ethics of technology. Moreover, it is suited to point out the deficiencies of the traditional concept of paternalism and to reform and vitalise the conception of paternalism in ethics in order to handle the challenges of technology."
417,Coping with continual danger: assessing alertness to visual disturbances in crucian carp following long-term exposure to chemical alarm signals.,24398068,Physiology & behavior. Volume: 126 Mar 14 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24398068/,"Chemical alarm signals in fish are passively released into the water from ruptured epidermal cells, and induce instant fright responses in conspecifics. Fish also display alarm responses to injured heterospecific skin, as well as to scent of piscivorous predators that have ingested prey. A conspicuous alertness to visual disturbances has also been observed in fish following long-term exposure to extracts of filtered, homogenized skin, but the chemical inducers of such vigilance are actually unknown. We tested if a continual exposure to water-soluble alarm signals, from either conspecifics or heterospecifics, affects alertness of fish. Based on previous experience, it was assumed that alertness could be detected following visual disturbances. Naïve crucian carp were initially exposed to the aqueous extracts of centrifuged skin homogenates, from either conspecifics, or from one out of four heterospecific species (tench, perch, Arctic charr, and brown trout). Darting movements, inter-individual distances, and vertical distribution were used to measure behavioral fright responses released by the test stimuli. After seven weeks of continual exposure to the same extracts, behavioral observations were repeated during visual disturbance. Compared with fish that were long-term exposed to skin extracts of tench or charr, crucian carp exposed to extracts of conspecifics, or to extracts of trout or perch, displayed lower inter-individual distances before being visually disturbed. However, no apparent fright responses were observed following such disturbances, and fish that had been continually exposed to conspecific chemical alarm signals displayed feeding behavior. Our results revealed that fish under assumed continual stress, induced by long-term presence of water-soluble alarm cues, only moderately changed their behavioral pattern. This further demonstrates that the aqueous part of extracts from homogenized skin does not contain any causative agents for inducing any conspicuous alertness. "

Volume: 31 Issue: 5 09 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28495184/,"Interleukin-1β (IL-1β) is a pleiotropic cytokine that exerts multiple roles in both physiological and pathological conditions. It is produced by different cell subsets, and drives a wide range of inflammatory responses in numerous target cells. Enhanced IL-1β signaling is a common event in patients of hematological malignancies. Recent body of evidence obtained in preclinical models shows the pathogenic role of these alterations, and the promising therapeutic value of IL-1 targeting. In this review, we further highlight a potential contribution of IL-1β linking to complications and autoimmune disease that should be investigated in future studies. Hence, drugs that target IL-1 may be helpful to improve outcome or reduce morbidity in patients. Some of them are FDA-approved, and used efficiently against autoimmune diseases, like IL-1 receptor antagonist. In the clinic, however, this agent seems to have limited properties. Current improved drugs will allow to determine the true potential of IL-1 and IL-1β targeting as therapy in hematological malignancies and their related complications."
419,Sex-related differences in growth and carbon allocation to defence in Populus tremula as explained by current plant defence theories.,24852570,Tree physiology. Volume: 34 Issue: 5 May 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24852570/,"Plant defence theories have recently evolved in such a way that not only the quantity but also the quality of mineral nutrients is expected to influence plant constitutive defence. Recently, an extended prediction derived from the protein competition model (PCM) suggested that nitrogen (N) limitation is more important for the production of phenolic compounds than phosphorus (P). We aimed at studying sexual differences in the patterns of carbon allocation to growth and constitutive defence in relation to N and P availability in Populus tremula L. seedlings. We compared the gender responses in photosynthesis, growth and whole-plant allocation to phenolic compounds at different combination levels of N and P, and studied how they are explained by the main plant defence theories. We found no sexual differences in phenolic concentrations, but interestingly, slow-growing females had higher leaf N concentration than did males, and genders differed in their allocation priority. There was a trade-off between growth and the production of flavonoid-derived phenylpropanoids on one hand, and between the production of salicylates and flavonoid-derived phenylpropanoids on the other. Under limited nutrient conditions, females prioritized mineral nutrient acquisition, flavonoid and condensed tannin (CT) production, while males invested more in above-ground biomass. Salicylate accumulation followed the growth differentiation balance hypothesis as low N mainly decreased the production of leaf and stem salicylate content while the combination of both low N and low P increased the amount of flavonoids and CTs allocated to leaves and to a lesser extent stems, which agrees with the PCM. We suggest that such a discrepancy in the responses of salicylates and flavonoid-derived CTs is linked to their clearly distinct biosynthetic origins and/or their metabolic costs."

Volume: 87 Issue: 2 Aug 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10989943/,"Pups and adult rats received seven oral exposures (three time weekly) of the food mutagen PhIP (50 mg/kg), or two subcutaneous exposures (once weekly) of the experimental carcinogen azoxymethane (3.75 mg/kg). Aberrant crypt foci (ACF) were scored 8 weeks after the first exposure. In addition, lactating dams with suckling pups were orally exposed to 50 mg/kg of PhIP, three times weekly for three weeks. Direct PhIP exposure of pups induced 2.2 times more ACF than similar exposure of adult rats (2.0+/-0.0 versus 0.9+/-0.8, P<0.05). The growth of ACF, expressed as crypt multiplicity AC/ACF, was 3.5 times larger in neonatally exposed rats than in rats exposed in adulthood (8.0+/-7.3 versus 2.3+/-1.6, P<0.05). PhIP exposure via breast milk induced ACF in 3 of 25 animals. However, the difference versus controls, which had no ACF, did not reach statistical significance. Contrary to PhIP, azoxymethane induced more ACF in adult rats than in pups (2.8+/-1.9 versus 4.8+/-1.7, P<0.05). Similarly to PhIP however, azoxymethane induced 3.2 times larger ACF (AC/ACF) in pups than in adult rats (11.9+/-8.4 versus 3.7+/-1.9, P<0.001). Whereas no PhIP-induced ACF (0/15) were observed in the lymphoid follicles, approximately 60% of the azoxymethane-induced ACF (32/56) were located in these structures. This difference was statistically significant (P<0.001). The density of azoxymethane-induced ACF was 80 times larger in the lymphoid follicles than in the surrounding mucosa (P<0.01). Based on the assumption that the formation of ACF with high multiplicity is predicative for the tumour development we conclude that neonatal rats are more susceptible to PhIP and azoxymethane than adult rats."

Volume: 16 Issue: 4 May 1988,1988,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3258825/,"A synthetic analogue of a pentapeptide associated with mature granulocytes has been described earlier and shown to suppress myelopoietic colony formation in vitro in concentrations from 10(-13) to 10(-6) M. By oxidation of the peptide, a dimer will rapidly occur by formation of disulfide bridges between cysteine residues. We here demonstrate that this dimer has the opposite effects of the monomer. For both mouse and human granulocyte-macrophage colony-forming units (CFU-GM), a dose-dependent enhancement of colony formation was observed in the dose range 10(-16) to 10(-5) M, where a saturation level was reached above 10(-8) M. At low doses of colony-stimulating activity (CSA) and in the linear stimulating phase, an up to ten times increase of colony formation was seen, whereas at higher doses the effect was less pronounced. Also at the plateau level of CSA stimulation an increased colony yield was seen. All types of colonies were stimulated. The dimer itself had no colony-stimulating factor activity and was not toxic to bone marrow cells in suspension cultures up to 24 h. Upon reduction of the dimer by use of sulfhydryl compounds, inhibitory effects on CFU-GM were restored. The peptide had no effect on the phagocytic process in human granulocytes, including attachment and internalization of bacteria or Zymosan particles. The monomerdimer equilibrium of hemoregulatory peptide may constitute a new mechanism for proliferative regulation of myelopoietic cells."

Thus, physical activity in relation to spinal cord injury, low back pain and heart disease is respectively means to regain bodily function, avoid or reduce pain and early death. A second analysis of three studies with a phenomenological-hermeneutic approach building on Ricoeur's philosophy on how people understand themselves and their world through narrative configurations revealed that physical activity had different meanings to people. This revealed that the meanings of physical activity could range from movements being unpleasant, maybe even painful to movements being a source of joy. This caused participants (1) to engage in movement as a source of joy, (2) to overcome the bodily struggle to do their chores, and maybe feel better as a result or (3) to minimize bodily functions equivalent to a functional daily life. Illustrated by 10 different approaches this provides knowledge about driving forces for health professional support. As joy and passion are the strongest driving forces to physical activity, this highlights the importance of supporting people to find a kind of physical activity that they like."

The memory of spatial frequency information was perfect across 10-sec interstimulus intervals. Presentation of a ""memory masker"" grating during the interstimulus interval may interfere with short-term memory. This interference depends on the relative spatial frequency of the test and masker gratings, with maximum interference at spatial frequency differences of 1-1.5 octaves and beyond. This range of interference with short-term memory is comparable to the bandwidth of sensory masking or adaptation. A change of the relative orientation of test and masker gratings does not produce interference with spatial frequency discrimination thresholds. These results suggest stimulus-specific interactions at higher-level representations of visual form."

In the rabbit the results have been divergent purportedly related to anaesthesia. The aim of this study was to investigate the importance of the KATP-channel in a rabbit model where anaesthesia was not a confounding factor. Isolated rabbit hearts perfused with a Krebs-Henseleit bicarbonate buffer were subjected to 30 min regional ischemia by ligating a coronary artery, followed by 120 min reperfusion. The preconditioning protocol was 5 min global ischemia and 10 min reperfusion. Glibenclamide (100 microM) was added to the perfusion solution before the preconditioning ischemia and stopped after 5 min regional ischemia. Infarcts were measured with tetrazolium staining and risk zones with fluorescent microspheres. The main results expressed as percent infarction of the risk zone +/- SEM for the different groups are as follows: control (n = 12) 26.8 +/- 3.2, ischemic preconditioning (IP) (n = 9) 7.3 +/- 1.5, (p < 0.05 vs. control), control + glibenclamide (n = 9) 46.9 +/- 7.3 (p < 0.05 vs. control), IP + glibenclamide (n = 10) 38.3 +/- 6.9 (p < 0.05 vs. IP).

Also, under the influence of glibenclamide ischemic preconditioning was no longer effective in reducing infarct size in the isolated perfused rabbit heart."

Polar cod Boreogadus saida were injected intraperitoneally with cod liver oil (solvent control), 6.6+/-3.7, 85+/-48 or 378+/-190 microg kg(-1) wet weight of benzo(a)pyrene (B(a)P), or not injected (control), and liver and bile were sampled at 0 and 16 h and 1, 2, 4 and 7d. The mRNA expression of cytochrome P4501A1 (cyp1a1) and glutathione S-transferase (gst) genes showed a dose-dependent induction in the first 16 h following the injection and a return to basal levels after 4d. The aryl hydrocarbon receptor 2, however, showed no change in mRNA expression. The protein quantification of cytochrome P4501A (CYP1A), through Western blot analysis and the enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), presented similar but weaker and time-delayed responses (4-7d) compared to the gene (16 h to 2d). Ethoxyresorufin O-deethylase (EROD) and glutathione S-transferase (GST) activities increased significantly at day 7 following the gene induction and increase in protein levels. Overall, these biomarkers showed dose-dependent but weak responses to B(a)P and low levels of bile metabolites. The mRNA expressions of oxidative stress genes, superoxide dismutases (sod(Cu/Zn) and sod(Mn)), catalase (cat) and glutathione peroxidase (gpx), were all up-regulated between 16 h and 2d of B(a)P exposure with cat (72-fold) and sod(Cu/Zn) (20-fold) giving the strongest responses in the highest dose. Finally, CAT protein level and enzyme activities showed less clear responses than the genes. The mRNA expression showed the earliest responses, followed by the protein levels. The enzymatic activities were the least sensitive and responded to the exposure after 7d. The study shows the induction capability of biomarkers in polar cod at very low bioavailable doses of B(a)P and provides new information on the selected biomarkers for use in oil monitoring in the Arctic."
432,Paired opposing leukocyte receptors recognizing rapidly evolving ligands are subject to homogenization of their ligand binding domains.,21720914,Immunogenetics. Volume: 63 Issue: 12 Dec 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21720914/,"Some leukocyte receptors come in groups of two or more where the partners share ligand(s) but transmit opposite signals. Some of the ligands, such as MHC class I, are fast evolving, raising the problem of how paired opposing receptors manage to change in step with respect to ligand binding properties and at the same time conserve opposite signaling functions. An example is the KLRC (NKG2) family, where opposing variants have been conserved in both rodents and primates. Phylogenetic analyses of the KLRC receptors within and between the two orders show that the opposing partners have been subject to post-speciation gene homogenization restricted mainly to the parts of the genes that encode the ligand binding domains. Concerted evolution similarly restricted is demonstrated also for the KLRI, KLRB (NKR-P1), KLRA (Ly49), and PIR receptor families. We propose the term merohomogenization for this phenomenon and discuss its significance for the evolution of immune receptors."

Volume: 35 Issue: 4 Aug 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21657816/,"Fine-needle aspiration cytology (FNAC) is an established, highly accurate, and cost-effective method for diagnosing lesions in different organs, including the breast. The method is minimally invasive without unwanted side effects. FNAC forms part of the triple assessment of breast lesions. Despite some shortcomings of the reporting categories, FNAC as part of the triple assessment has proved its value in describing the findings most accurately. The diagnostic impact depends on experience of the operator, quality of preparation, and diagnostic skills of the cytopathologist. The highest accuracy is achieved at centers with a multidisciplinary approach. FNAC is often palpation guided from palpable breast masses, whereas ultrasonography guidance is more widely used on nonpalpable lesions. Inadequate sampling with FNAC is particularly seen in collagenous lesions and in submitted specimens sampled by physicians lacking experience with the FNAC procedure. A diagnostic biopsy is recommended when FNAC provides scant material. FNAC is considered to be a safe method for screening purposes, although moderately less sensitive than core needle biopsy. FNAC is most accurate when experienced cytopathologists are available to assess the adequacy of the aspirated material and advise on additional aspirations for ancillary tests when needed."

Volume: 181 Issue: 8 Oct 15 2008",2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18832702/,"Atypical invariant chain (Ii) CLIP fragments (CLIP2) have been found in association with HLA-DQ2 (DQ2) purified from cell lysates. We mapped the binding register of CLIP2 (Ii 96-104) to DQ2 and found proline at the P1 position, in contrast to the canonical CLIP1 (Ii 83-101) register with methionine at P1. CLIP1/2 peptides are the predominant peptide species, even for DQ2 from HLA-DM (DM)-expressing cells. We hypothesized that DQ2-CLIP1/2 might be poor substrates for DM. We measured DM-mediated exchange of CLIP and other peptides for high-affinity indicator peptides and found it is inefficient for DQ2. DM-DQ-binding and DM chaperone effects on conformation and levels of DQ are also reduced for DQ2, compared with DQ1. We suggest that the unusual interaction of DQ2 with Ii and DM may provide a basis for the known disease associations of DQ2."
435,"Quantitative characteristics of Atlantic halibut, Hippoglossus hippoglossus L., semen throughout the reproductive season.",16233911,Theriogenology. Volume: 65 Issue: 8 May 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16233911/,"The overall objective of the study was to investigate changes in quantitative parameters of Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus L.) semen throughout the reproductive season in order to systematize the knowledge about biology of Atlantic halibut spermatozoa. Semen samples were collected from February to May from broodstock males kept under either a natural or 3-month advanced photoperiod regime. Spermatozoa concentration, semen pH and osmolality, as well as spermatozoa motility parameters were investigated. The use of catheterization of sperm was examined. Also, fertilization tests were performed. We found that spermatozoa concentration increases in a linear-like mode towards the end of the spawning season, which correlated with a decrease in a number of spermatozoa motility parameters, including actual percentage of motile spermatozoa (MOT), curvilinear velocity (VCL) and straight-line velocity (VSL) of spermatozoa. A breakpoint in MOT occurred when spermatozoa reached a concentration in the range of 17-20 x 10(9) spermatozoa/mL. The fertilization ability of sperm from males kept under natural photoperiod decreased in April. Survival of embryos at 80 degrees days produced by fertilizing eggs of single female with sperm from natural photoperiod males was 88, 76 and 41% on April 09 and 17, and May 01, respectively, whereas using sperm from 3-month delayed photoperiod males for fertilizing eggs from the same female on April 27 resulted in 80% of surviving embryos, not differing significantly from the data from April 09. Physical decomposition of spermatozoa was observed towards the end of the season and it was related to an increase in the whole semen osmolality. Catheterization of semen did not improve spermatozoa motility parameters, however, it reduced the variation in recorded values, especially in the case of pH, caused by contamination with feces or urine. Post-seasonal decrease in spermatozoa concentration was likely related to intensive ageing processes. Based on the present study and available data by other researchers, a model of changes of quantitative parameters in Atlantic halibut semen throughout the reproductive season is proposed."

Rewardless flowers of the orchid Erycina pusilla have an enlarged median sepal and incised median petal ('lip') to attract oil-collecting bees. These bees also forage on similar looking but rewarding Malpighiaceae flowers that have five unequally sized petals and gland-carrying sepals. The lip of E. pusilla has a 'callus' that, together with winged 'stelidia', mimics these glands. Different hypotheses exist about the evolutionary origin of the median sepal, callus and stelidia of orchid flowers."

Volume: 14 Issue: 2 Feb 12 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24467394/,"We report on the epitaxial growth of large-area position-controlled self-catalyzed GaAs nanowires (NWs) directly on Si by molecular beam epitaxy (MBE). Nanohole patterns are defined in a SiO2 mask on 2 in. Si wafers using nanoimprint lithography (NIL) for the growth of positioned GaAs NWs. To optimize the yield of vertical NWs the MBE growth parameter space is tuned, including Ga predeposition time, Ga and As fluxes, growth temperature, and annealing treatment prior to NW growth. In addition, a non-negligible radial growth is observed with increasing growth time and is found to be independent of the As species (i.e., As2 or As4) and the growth temperatures studied. Cross-sectional transmission electron microscopy analysis of the GaAs NW/Si substrate heterointerface reveals an epitaxial growth where NW base fills the oxide hole opening and eventually extends over the oxide mask. These findings have important implications for NW-based device designs with axial and radial p-n junctions. Finally, NIL positioned GaAs/AlGaAs core-shell heterostructured NWs are grown on Si to study the optical properties of the NWs. Room-temperature photoluminescence spectroscopy of ensembles of as-grown core-shell NWs reveals uniform and high optical quality, as required for the subsequent device applications. The combination of NIL and MBE thereby demonstrates the successful heterogeneous integration of highly uniform GaAs NWs on Si, important for fabricating high throughput, large-area position-controlled NW arrays for various optoelectronic device applications.

439,Hemodynamics and tissue blood flow after porcine surfactant replacement in surfactant-depleted newborn piglets.,8827769,Pediatric research. Volume: 40 Issue: 2 Aug 1996,1996,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8827769/,"In 22 newborn piglets we studied the effect of hypovolemia or hypoxemia on hemodynamics and regional blood flow after instillation of porcine surfactant. Surfactant deficiency was obtained by repeated lung lavage, and blood flow measurements were carried out using radioactive microspheres. Three groups of piglets were studied, controls (n = 8), hypovolemia (n = 7), and hypoxemia (n = 7). Three to five minutes after instillation of surfactant, mean arterial blood pressure decreased significantly in all three groups with a mean decrease (+/- SD) of 31(+/- 12), 33(+/- 9), and 29(+/- 9) mm Hg, respectively (p < 0.01 in all three groups). Systemic vascular resistance decreased significantly in all three groups immediately after surfactant instillation (p < 0.01) and returned to presurfactant level after 60 min. Blood flow did not change after surfactant instillation in any of the three groups, in neither skin, muscle, pancreas, brain, nor retina. In liver, kidney, intestine, and choroidea there was a decrease in blood flow immediately after instillation with return to presur-factant levels within 60 min. Hypoxemia or hypovolemia before surfactant instillation did not increase the hemodynamic instability. The decrease in mean arterial blood pressure was caused by a vasodilation and not by a reduced cardiac output."

Clinically, the triplets were equally affected. Mutation analysis in this family revealed a novel recessively expressed glycine substitution, G2031S, in exon 73 of the collagen VII gene COL7A1. Most glycine substitutions in this gene region encoding for the triple helical domain of collagen VII are associated with milder, dominantly inherited phenotypes. By contrast, the novel point mutation of this study is clinically silent in the heterozygous state and leads to a severe DEB subtype when homozygous."

Volume: 14 Issue: 1 Feb 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18841461/,"Concurrent partnerships may cause more rapid spread of HIV in a population. We examined how the prevalence of parallel relationships changed among men and women aged 15-49 in Zambia from 1998 to 2003 using data collected during the Sexual Behavior Surveys 1998, 2000, and 2003. Predictors of concurrent partnerships among men were studied by univariate and multivariate regression analyses. Thirteen percent of rural and 8% of urban men reported more than one ongoing relationship in 1998, and these proportions declined to 8% and 6%, respectively in 2003. The proportion of women reporting concurrent relationships was 0-2%. The most important predictors of concurrency were early sexual debut, being married, early marriage and absence from home. The reduction in concurrent sexual partnerships is consistent with reductions in other sexual risk behaviors found in other studies and may have contributed to the recently observed decline in HIV prevalence in Zambia."

444,A Simplified Approach to Measure the Effect of the Microvasculature in Diffusion-weighted MR Imaging Applied to Breast Tumors: Preliminary Results.,27128662,Radiology. Volume: 281 Issue: 2 Nov 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27128662/,"Purpose To evaluate the relative change of the apparent diffusion coefficient (ADC) at low- and medium-b-value regimens as a surrogate marker of microcirculation, to study its correlation with dynamic contrast agent-enhanced (DCE) magnetic resonance (MR) imaging-derived parameters, and to assess its potential for differentiation between malignant and benign breast tumors. Materials and Methods Ethics approval and informed consent were obtained. From May 2013 to June 2015, 61 patients diagnosed with either malignant or benign breast tumors were prospectively recruited. All patients were scanned with a 3-T MR imager, including diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI) and DCE MR imaging. Parametric analysis of DWI and DCE MR imaging was performed, including a proposed marker, relative enhanced diffusivity (RED). Spearman correlation was calculated between DCE MR imaging and DWI parameters, and the potential of the different DWI-derived parameters for differentiation between malignant and benign breast tumors was analyzed by dividing the sample into equally sized training and test sets. Optimal cut-off values were determined with receiver operating characteristic curve analysis in the training set, which were then used to evaluate the independent test set. Results RED had a Spearman rank correlation of 0.61 with the initial area under the curve calculated from DCE MR imaging. Furthermore, RED differentiated cancers from benign tumors with an overall accuracy of 90% (27 of 30) on the test set with 88.2% (15 of 17) sensitivity and 92.3% (12 of 13) specificity. Conclusion This study presents promising results introducing a simplified approach to assess results from a DWI protocol sensitive to the intravoxel incoherent motion effect by using only three b values. This approach could potentially aid in the differentiation, characterization, and monitoring of breast pathologies. © RSNA, 2016 Online supplemental material is available for this article."

Volume: 47 Issue: 1 Aug 01 2009,2009,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19341802/,"False discovery rate (FDR) control has become a standard technique in neuroimaging. Recent work has shown that a finer grained estimate of the FDR is obtained by estimating, at a specific value of the test statistic, the scaled ratio of the null density to the observed density of the test statistic. The method can be extended by allowing an external covariate, also measured on the points where the hypothesis was tested, to modulate estimation of this local FDR. The current work, in addition to demonstrating these methods by re-analyzing results from two previously published investigations of cortical thickness, presents a method to test if the covariate modulation differs significantly from chance. The first study compared schizophrenia patients to healthy controls and the second compared genotypes of the -633 T/A polymorphism of the gene coding the brain derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) protein in a subset of the subjects from the case/control study. Local FDR estimates increased findings over FDR in both studies. Using p-values from the case/control study to modulate local FDR estimation in the BDNF study further increased findings. The relationship between case/control related and BDNF related cortical thickness variation was found to be highly significant, providing support for this gene's involvement in the etiology of the disease. The increased statistical precision from more accurate models of the distribution of the test statistic demonstrates the potential of these methods for neuroimaging and suggests the possibility to test novel hypothesis."

Based on current guidelines, ultrasound contrast is indicated for left ventricular opacification at rest in patients with suboptimal echocardiographic images, and in stress echocardiography when >or= 2 adjacent segments are poorly visualised. Adding contrast for assessment of regional myocardial perfusion expands the use of echocardiography in ischemic heart disease from detection of left ventricular dysfunction at rest or during stress to assessment of myocardial ischemia, extent of myocardial necrosis and re-flow after coronary revascularisation. Myocardial perfusion also adds prognostic information to that given by structural and functional assessment alone and may reduce the need for more time consuming, expensive cardiac imaging procedures associated with radiation as well as coronary angiography with the risk of vascular complications. This article gives an overview of ultrasound contrast agents and their impact on echocardiographic assessment of ischemic heart disease also discussing recent patents."

Although integrin alpha 4 beta 7 appears to be the main receptor for gut-homing T lymphocytes, less is known about molecules mediating mucosal B cell homing. Expression of integrin alpha 4 beta 7 on B lymphocytes, B cell blasts, and plasma cells in human gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT; the Peyer's patches and appendix) and lamina propria was studied by multi-colour immunofluorescence applied on cryosections. Isolated mononuclear cells from the same tissue compartments were examined by flow cytometry and compared with peripheral blood B cells. Integrin alpha 4 beta 7 was expressed by IgA+ B cell blasts and plasma cells (CD38high) in the lamina propria, B cell blasts in GALT, and sIgD+ B lymphocytes in peripheral blood. In contrast, GALT sIgD+ B lymphocytes were negative or only weakly positive for alpha 4 beta 7. These results suggested that B lymphocytes down-regulate alpha 4 beta 7 upon extravasation in GALT but up-regulate this integrin after antigen-priming. Thus, alpha 4 beta 7 may be a homing receptor also for B cell blasts extravasating in the gut lamina propria, where this integrin is maintained on plasma cells, perhaps as a local retention factor."

Limited research has been performed on patients with brain-only disease. We analyzed patterns of treatment, brain control and survival in uni- and multivariate analyses. All 25 patients with brain-only disease were treated with radiotherapy (whole-brain radiotherapy (WBRT) with or without stereotactic radiotherapy/radiosurgery (SRS) or surgical resection) and most patients with systemic treatment later during the disease trajectory. Only a minority of patients remained free from brain progression at 1 year after their initial therapy, regardless of initial treatment approach (median brain progression-free survival 6.2 months). However, overall survival was significantly better after initial surgical resection/SRS as compared to upfront WBRT (median 24.1 and 5.2 months, respectively). For all patients combined, median survival was 11.7 months (2-year survival rate 28 %). Several prognostic factors for shorter survival were identified in multivariate regression analysis: lower KPS, triple-negative tumor, coordination deficit, older age, lack of upfront surgical resection or SRS, and lack of endocrine or HER2-directed therapy after brain metastases treatment. Although durable brain control and long-term survival beyond 5 years could be achieved in a subset of patients (largely after successful salvage), progression of brain metastases during the first year after diagnosis was common. Prognosis was influenced by patient-, disease- and treatment-related factors. "

Volume: 222 Issue: 4 May 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27629271/,"Perivascular endfeet of astrocytes are enriched with aquaporin-4 (AQP4)-a water channel that is critically involved in water transport at the brain-blood interface and that recently was identified as a key molecule in a system for waste clearance. The factors that determine the size of the perivascular AQP4 pool remain to be identified. Here we show that the size of this pool differs considerably between brain regions, roughly mirroring regional differences in Aqp4 mRNA copy numbers. We demonstrate that a targeted deletion of α-syntrophin-a member of the dystrophin complex responsible for AQP4 anchoring-removes a substantial and fairly constant proportion (79-94 %) of the perivascular AQP4 pool across the central nervous system (CNS). Quantitative immunogold analyses of AQP4 and α-syntrophin in perivascular membranes indicate that there is a fixed stoichiometry between these two molecules. Both molecules occur at higher densities in endfoot membrane domains facing pericytes than in endfoot membrane domains facing endothelial cells. Our data suggest that irrespective of region, endfoot targeting of α-syntrophin is the single most important factor determining the size of the perivascular AQP4 pool and hence the capacity for water transport at the brain-blood interface."
461,Routine outcome measures in Norway: Only partly implemented.,26256034,"International review of psychiatry (Abingdon, England). Volume: 27 Issue: 4 2015",2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26256034/,"Norway has not had any strategy exclusively for the implementation of routine outcome measurement in the mental health services, but some efforts have been made as part of strategies for a national patient register and quality indicators. Fifteen years after the decision to make the rating of the Global Assessment of Functioning scale (GAF) mandatory at admission and discharge of each treatment episode in adult mental health services, this is still not fully implemented. An unknown and probably very low proportion of mental health services use GAF as a routine outcome measure in everyday clinical practice. Well-established electronic patient records in the mental health services and established procedures for reporting routine data to the National Patient Register should make it possible to collect and use routine outcome data. Implementation of routine outcome measurement in mental health services must be done with due emphasis on the critical steps in the various phases of the implementation process. The regional health authorities have a key role in establishing electronic systems that make relevant outcome measurements available in a seamless way for clinicians as well as for patients, and by contributing to a culture where quality and outcome are valued and given priority.

We present survey results which show that many conservation practitioners use cheaper 'recreational' units for research rather than more expensive 'professional' equipment. We present our perspective of using two popular models of 'recreational' camera trap for ecological field-based studies. The models used (for >2 years) presented us with a range of practical problems at all stages of their use including deployment, operation, and data management, which collectively crippled data collection and limited opportunities for quantification of key issues arising. Our experiences demonstrate that prospective users need to have a sufficient understanding of the limitations camera trap technology poses, dimensions we communicate here. While the merits of different camera traps will be study specific, the performance of more expensive 'professional' models may prove more cost-effective in the long-term when using camera traps for research.

Volume: 11 Issue: 2 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26889677/,"The evolution of drug resistant parasitic sea lice is of major concern to the salmon farming industry worldwide and challenges sustainable growth of this enterprise. To assess current status and development of L. salmonis sensitivity towards different pesticides used for parasite control in Norwegian salmon farming, a national surveillance programme was implemented in 2013. The programme aims to summarize data on the use of different pesticides applied to control L. salmonis and to test L. salmonis sensitivity to different pesticides in farms along the Norwegian coast. Here we analyse two years of test-data from biological assays designed to detect sensitivity-levels towards the pesticides azamethiphos and deltamethrin, both among the most common pesticides used in bath-treatments of farmed salmon in Norway in later years. The focus of the analysis is on how different variables predict the binomial outcome of the bioassay tests, being whether L. salmonis are immobilized/die or survive pesticide exposure. We found that local kernel densities of bath treatments, along with a spatial geographic index of test-farm locations, were significant predictors of the binomial outcome of the tests. Furthermore, the probability of L. salmonis being immobilized/dead after test-exposure was reduced by odds-ratios of 0.60 (95% CI: 0.42-0.86) for 2014 compared to 2013 and 0.39 (95% CI: 0.36-0.42) for low concentration compared to high concentration exposure. There were also significant but more marginal effects of parasite gender and developmental stage, and a relatively large random effect of test-farm. We conclude that the present data support an association between local intensities of bath treatments along the coast and the outcome of bioassay tests where salmon lice are exposed to azamethiphos or deltamethrin. Furthermore, there is a predictable structure of L. salmonis phenotypes along the coast in the data, characterized by high susceptibility to pesticides in the far north and far south, but low susceptibility in mid Norway. The study emphasizes the need to address local susceptibility to pesticides and the need for restrictive use of pesticides to preserve treatment efficacy. "

Unconditional tests preserve the significance level and generally are more powerful than Fisher's exact test for moderate to small samples, but previously were disadvantaged by being computationally demanding. This disadvantage is now moot, as software to facilitate unconditional tests has been available for years. Moreover, Fisher's exact test with mid-p adjustment gives about the same results as an unconditional test. Consequently, several better tests are available, and the choice of a test should depend only on its merits for the application involved. Unconditional tests and the mid-p approach ought to be used more than they now are. The traditional Fisher's exact test should practically never be used."

To test the hypothesis that osmotic effects may be involved in these fluid-loss processes, head-out immersion experiments in 38 degrees C freshwater (FW) and SW for 4 h were performed. Average BW reduction was 2.5 and 1.9 kg in SW and FW head-out immersion, respectively (P < 0.01). Atrial natriuretic peptide increased during the first 30 min of SW immersion (5.6-13.4 pmol/l, P < 0.01) followed by a reduction to 7.6 pmol/l (P < 0.01). This paralleled an initial decrease in aldosterone (from 427 to 306 pmol/l, P < 0.05) followed by an increase to 843 pmol/l (P < 0.01). The effects of temperature on fluid loss were studied in thermoneutral (34.5 degrees C) and 38 degrees C SW for 2 h. In thermoneutral SW, calculated sweat production was negligible (0.05 kg) compared with 1.2 kg in warm SW. We recommend that, if a dive is planned to last for more than 4 h, a mandatory break for fluid intake should be incorporated in the diving regulations."

DCI involves all parts of the organism where gas bubbles are produced. They have both primary and secondary effects and have been classified as an agonist aggregating human platelets. In vitro effects of N2 bubbles on porcine platelets were investigated. Comparative studies using two different anticoagulants and three different sampling methods were performed. A disappearance of single platelets interpreted as platelet aggregation was observed in the presence of N2 bubbles in all studied groups. Aggregatory responses were more profound with platelets in heparinized plasma than in citrated plasma. In citrated plasma the aggregatory responses were more profound when blood was obtained from nonanaesthetized (awake) animals than from slaugtherhouse animals. Adrenaline (1 microM) had an inhibitory effect on N2 bubble induced platelet aggregation in vitro. The pig could be useful to investigate possible gas bubble effects in vivo.

Volume: 87 Issue: 2 07 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27121542/,"In flowering plants, male gametes arise via meiosis of diploid pollen mother cells followed by two rounds of mitotic division. Haploid microspores undergo polar nuclear migration and asymmetric division at pollen mitosis I to segregate the male germline, followed by division of the germ cell to generate a pair of sperm cells. We previously reported two gemini pollen (gem) mutants that produced twin-celled pollen arising from polarity and cytokinesis defects at pollen mitosis I in Arabidopsis. Here, we report an independent mutant, gem3, with a similar division phenotype and severe genetic transmission defects through pollen. Cytological analyses revealed that gem3 disrupts cell division during male meiosis, at pollen mitosis I and during female gametophyte development. We show that gem3 is a hypomorphic allele (aug6-1) of AUGMIN subunit 6, encoding a conserved component in the augmin complex, which mediates microtubule (MT)-dependent MT nucleation in acentrosomal cells. We show that MT arrays are disturbed in gem3/aug6-1 during male meiosis and pollen mitosis I using fluorescent MT-markers. Our results demonstrate a broad role for the augmin complex in MT organization during sexual reproduction, and highlight gem3/aug6-1 mutants as a valuable tool for the investigation of augmin-dependent MT nucleation and dynamics in plant cells."

Volume: 187 Issue: 3 03 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27859020/,"This study aimed to examine whether acute intermittent porphyria (AIP) is associated with systemic inflammation and whether the inflammation correlates with disease activity. A case-control study with 50 AIP cases and age-, sex- and place of residence-matched controls was performed. Plasma cytokines, insulin and C-peptide were analysed after an overnight fast using multiplex assay. Long pentraxin-3 (PTX3) and complement activation products (C3bc and TCC) were analysed using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Urine porphobilinogen ratio (U-PBG, µmol/mmol creatinine), haematological and biochemical tests were performed using routine methods. Questionnaires were used to register AIP symptoms, medication and other diseases. All 27 cytokines, chemokines and growth factors investigated were increased significantly in symptomatic AIP cases compared with controls (P < 0·0004). Hierarchical cluster analyses revealed a cluster with high visfatin levels and several highly expressed cytokines including interleukin (IL)-17, suggesting a T helper type 17 (Th17) inflammatory response in a group of AIP cases. C3bc (P = 0·002) and serum immunoglobulin (Ig)G levels (P = 0·03) were increased significantly in cases with AIP. The U-PBG ratio correlated positively with PTX3 (r = 0·38, P = 0·006), and with terminal complement complex (TCC) levels (r = 0·33, P = 0·02). PTX3 was a significant predictor of the biochemical disease activity marker U-PBG in AIP cases after adjustment for potential confounders in multiple linear regression analyses (P = 0·032). Prealbumin, C-peptide, insulin and kidney function were all decreased in the symptomatic AIP cases, but not in the asymptomatic cases. These results indicate that AIP is associated with systemic inflammation. Decreased C-peptide levels in symptomatic AIP cases indicate that reduced insulin release is associated with enhanced disease activity and reduced kidney function."

Volume: 221 Issue: Pt 1 01 10 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29113988/,"Arctic homeotherms counter challenges at high latitudes using a combination of seasonal adjustments in pelage/plumage, fat deposition and intricate thermoregulatory adaptations. However, there are still gaps in our understanding of their thermal responses to cold, particularly in Arctic birds. Here, we have studied the potential use of local heterothermy (i.e. tissue cooling that can contribute to significantly lower heat loss rate) in Svalbard ptarmigan (Lagopus muta hyperborea) - the world's northernmost land bird. We exposed birds kept under simulated Svalbard photoperiod to low ambient temperatures (Ta; between 0 and -30°C) during three seasons (early winter, late winter, summer), whilst recording resting metabolic rate (RMR), core temperature (Tc) and several cutaneous temperatures. Leg skin temperature varied the most, but still only by up to ∼15°C, whereas body trunk skin temperature changed <1°C when Ta decreased from 0 to -30°C. At the same time, Tc increased by 0.9°C, concomitant with increased RMR. This was probably driven by the triggering of cerebral thermosensors in response to cooling of the poorly insulated head, the skin of which was 5.4°C colder at -30°C than at 0°C. Thermal conductance in winter was higher in yearlings, probably because they were time/resource constrained from acquiring a high-quality plumage and sufficient fat reserves as a result of concomitant body growth. In conclusion, Svalbard ptarmigan do not employ extensive local heterothermy for cold protection but instead rely on efficient thermogenesis combined with excellent body insulation. Hence, cold defence in the world's northernmost land bird is not mechanistically much different from that of its lower latitude relatives."

We established progressively growing intracerebral xenografts in athymic nude rats generated from three different human GBM surgical specimens. The lesions were identified by MRI and subsequently injected with a concentrated vector stock. The animals were killed 10 or 30 days after G207 injection and the tumors were quantitatively evaluated for virus-induced changes in proliferation, apoptosis and vascularity. Moreover, we assessed vector spread as well as the infiltration pattern of CD68-positive inflammatory cells. In all G207-injected lesions, immunostaining identified widespread regions of viral infection and replication (plaques). Proliferation indices were significantly lower, whereas apoptotic counts were significantly elevated in plaques as compared with that in non-infected areas of the same lesions, as well as in corresponding control xenografts. Furthermore, there was a significant decline in the number of blood vessels in the plaques and the vascular area fractions were reduced. CD68-positive inflammatory cells accumulated in the plaques. The present study highlights the favorable cellular responses to G207 treatment seen from a clinical viewpoint, such as reduced tumor cell proliferation, more frequent events of tumor cell death and a strongly attenuated tumor vascular compartment. However, our results suggest that transduction of a significant volume of tumor tissue is essential, as these beneficial changes were only observed in areas of active viral replication, leaving non-transduced tumor tissues unaffected."

Volume: 50 12 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27350294/,"Reference pricing intends to reduce pharmaceutical expenditures by increasing demand elasticity and stimulating generic competition. We develop a novel model where a brand-name producer competes in prices with several generics producers in a market with brand-biased and brand-neutral consumers. Comparing with coinsurance, we show that reference pricing, contrary to policy makers' intentions, discourages generic entry, as it induces the brand-name producer to price more aggressively. Thus, the net effect of reference pricing on drug prices is ambiguous, implying that reference pricing can be counterproductive in reducing expenditures. However, under price regulation, we show that reference pricing may stimulate generic entry, since a binding price cap weakens the aggressive price response by the brand-name producer. This may explain mixed empirical results on the competitive effects of reference pricing. Finally, we show that reference pricing may be welfare improving when accounting for brand preferences despite its adverse effects on entry and prices."

Production of fish in high-density growth conditions requires effective vaccines in order to control persistent and emerging diseases. Vaccines can also have significant positive impact on the reduced usage of antibiotics.

The present review will focus on current vaccine applications for farmed industrialized fish species such as Atlantic salmon, coho salmon (Oncorhynchus kisutch), rainbow trout (Oncorhynchus mykiss), ayu (Plecoglossus altivelis), cod (Gadus morhua), sea bass (Dicentrarchus labrax), gilt-head sea bream (Sparus aurata), yellowtail (Seriola quinqueradiata), great amberjack (Seriola dumerili), barramundi (Lates calcarifer), japanese flounder (Paralichythys olivaceus), turbot (Scophthalmus maximus), red sea bream (Pagrus major), rock bream (Oplegnathus fasciatus), seven band grouper (Epinephelus septemfasciatus), striped catfish (Pangasianodon hypophthalmus), channel catfish (Ictalurus punctatus) and tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus). This paper will review the current use of licensed vaccines in fin fish farming and describe vaccine administration regimes including immersion, oral and injection vaccination. Future trends for inactivated-, live attenuated - and DNA - vaccines will also be discussed. "

Volume: 156 Issue: 2 Aug 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22642926/,"The juvenile hormone, methyl farnesoate (MF), and its analog insecticides have been used successfully to induce the production of males in cladocerans under long-day conditions in the laboratory. However, without hormone addition Daphnia do not usually produce male offspring under long photoperiods, while short photoperiods are a stimulus for the induction of males. We used 21 clones of Daphnia pulex differing in their propensity to produce males under short-day conditions to test whether the treatment with MF would result in an additive effect of shifting the sex ratio towards males. Contrary to our expectations, clones with a high tendency of male production showed a reduced sex ratio in response to MF treatment under short-day conditions, but clones that produced normally few males or did not produce males were stimulated by 700 nM MF to produce up to 40% males. We suggest that the endocrine disruptive effect of MF or juvenile hormone analogs in the field may depend on the clonal composition of the cladoceran population and on the natural photoperiod. This may affect the seasonal occurrence of sexual reproduction and eventually cause a mismatch between the presence of males and ephippial females."

In multivariable calibrated models, there was a statistically significant inverse association between total fat intake and risk of HCC (per 10 g/day, HR = 0.80, 95% CI: 0.65-0.99), which was mainly driven by monounsaturated fats (per 5 g/day, HR = 0.71, 95% CI: 0.55-0.92) rather than polyunsaturated fats (per 5 g/day, HR = 0.92, 95% CI: 0.68-1.25).

The ratio of polyunsaturated/monounsaturated fats to saturated fats was not significantly associated with HCC risk (per 0.2 point, HR = 0.86, 95% CI: 0.73-1.01). Restriction of analyses to HBV/HCV free participants or adjustment for liver function did not substantially alter the findings. In this large prospective European cohort, higher consumption of monounsaturated fats is associated with lower HCC risk."
487,Persistent posterior and transient anterior medial temporal lobe activity during navigation.,20677377,NeuroImage. Volume: 52 Issue: 4 Oct 01 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20677377/,"A functional segregation along the posterior-anterior axis of the medial temporal lobe (MTL) has been suggested. In brief, it is thought that the posterior hippocampus represents environmental detail and/or encodes space, whereas the anterior part represents the environment more as a whole and/or subserves behavior. Different phases of navigation should thus recruit different structures within the MTL. Based on animal studies and neuroimaging data from humans, the initial phase of navigation, i.e., self-localization, target localization and path planning, should depend on the anterior MTL independent of upcoming navigational demands, whereas posterior MTL should be active throughout navigation. We tested this prediction using fMRI with navigation in a learned large-scale virtual office landscape with numerous complex landmarks under different navigational conditions. The initial navigational phase specifically engaged the anterior MTL. Increased activity was found bilaterally in the rostral and caudal entorhinal cortex. This is, to our knowledge, the first report of entorhinal activity in virtual navigation detected in a direct comparison. Also bilateral anterior hippocampus and anterior parahippocampal cortex were significantly more active during the initial phase. Activity lasting throughout the navigational period was found in the right posterior hippocampus and parahippocampal cortex. Hippocampal activity for the entire navigation period was only detected when the virtual environment remained unaltered. Navigational success was positively correlated with activity in the anterior right hippocampus for the initial phase, and more posteriorly in the hippocampus for the whole navigation period. Plots of the BOLD signal time course demonstrated that activity in the anterior hippocampus was transient whereas activity in the posterior hippocampus peaked regularly throughout the entire navigation period. These results support a functional segregation within the MTL with regard to navigational phases. The anterior MTL appears to complete associations related to the environment at large and provide a behavioral plan for navigation, whereas the posterior part keeps track of current location."

A statistically significant difference was found between the cases with and those without increased pleural effusion, indicating that the time spent in water is correlated to the production of pleural fluid. A significant difference was also found between saltwater and freshwater drownings, indicating that more pleural fluid is produced in saltwater than in freshwater drownings."

In contrast, the use of herbicides, fungicides, and growth regulators reduces lodging and foliar disease severity but had no effect on phenolic acid and flavonoid concentrations. The use of composted FYM inputs also resulted in a significant grain yield reduction and not substantially reduced the severity of opportunistic pathogens such as Septoria, which remain a major yield limiting factor unless fungicides are used and/or more Septoria resistant varieties become available."

After these episodes they noticed that the urine was dark brown, indicating rhabdomyolysis and myoglobinuria. The neurological examinations were without remarks. There was no lactate increase in the ischaemic forearm exercise test. Both had very low PGK levels in muscle, erythrocytes, leukocytes and fibroblasts. This is the first family with more than one affected case of PGK deficiency and exercise-induced stiffness, myalgia and rhabdomyolysis. The clinical manifestations may resemble myophosphorylase deficiency (McArdle's disease: glycogenosis Type V) and muscle phosphofructokinase deficiency (Tarui's disease: glycogenosis Type VII). PGK deficiency is inherited as an X-linked trait and may show other features such as mental retardation and/or haemolytic anaemia."

The independent prognostic value of the genes ranking the highest in univariate analysis, together with clinical parameters, was assessed by Cox multivariate regression analysis. The P-values from these logrank tests were also mapped to chromosomal positions and compared with previously reported amplicon regions. We used PubGene web tools to identify groups of genes that had co-occurred in the literature and whose expression patterns were associated with survival. Our analyses demonstrate the comprehensiveness of the microarray technology with respect to measuring gene expression and indicate that the technology may be used to screen for potential clinical markers."

Volume: 17 Issue: 3 Mar 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16371508/,"Shiga toxin (Stx) is composed of an A-moiety that inhibits protein synthesis after translocation into the cytosol, and a B-moiety that binds to Gb3 at the cell surface and mediates endocytosis of the toxin. After endocytosis, Stx is transported retrogradely to the endoplasmic reticulum, and then the A-fragment enters the cytosol. In this study, we have investigated whether toxin-induced signaling is involved in its entry. Stx was found to activate Syk and induce rapid tyrosine phosphorylation of several proteins, one protein being clathrin heavy chain. Toxin-induced clathrin phosphorylation required Syk activity, and in cells overexpressing Syk, a complex containing clathrin and Syk could be demonstrated. Depletion of Syk by small interfering RNA, expression of a dominant negative Syk mutant (Syk KD), or treatment with the Syk inhibitor piceatannol inhibited not only Stx-induced clathrin phosphorylation but also endocytosis of the toxin. Also, Golgi transport of Stx was inhibited under all these conditions. In conclusion, our data suggest that Stx regulates its entry into target cells."

One of its advantages is that undesirable photosensitization lasts only for 24-48 h. In order to optimize ALA-PDT it is necessary to understand the mechanisms of intracellular production and clearance of PpIX (efflux from cells into blood stream and/or its conversion into haem). The aim of this study is to investigate the factors controlling the clearance of intracellular PpIX from healthy skin of mice.
502,Calcium modulates calmodulin/α-actinin 1 interaction with and agonist-dependent internalization of the adenosine A2A receptor.,28130124,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Molecular cell research. Volume: 1864 Issue: 4 Apr 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28130124/,"Adenosine receptors are G protein-coupled receptors that sense extracellular adenosine to transmit intracellular signals. One of the four adenosine receptor subtypes, the adenosine A2A receptor (A2AR), has an exceptionally long intracellular C terminus (A2AR-ct) that mediates interactions with a large array of proteins, including calmodulin and α-actinin. Here, we aimed to ascertain the α-actinin 1/calmodulin interplay whilst binding to A2AR and the role of Ca2+ in this process. First, we studied the A2AR-α-actinin 1 interaction by means of native polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis, isothermal titration calorimetry, and surface plasmon resonance, using purified recombinant proteins. α-Actinin 1 binds the A2AR-ct through its distal calmodulin-like domain in a Ca2+-independent manner with a dissociation constant of 5-12μM, thus showing an ~100 times lower affinity compared to the A2AR-calmodulin/Ca2+ complex. Importantly, calmodulin displaced α-actinin 1 from the A2AR-ct in a Ca2+-dependent fashion, disrupting the A2AR-α-actinin 1 complex. Finally, we assessed the impact of Ca2+ on A2AR internalization in living cells, a function operated by the A2AR-α-actinin 1 complex. Interestingly, while Ca2+ influx did not affect constitutive A2AR endocytosis, it abolished agonist-dependent internalization. In addition, we demonstrated that the A2AR/α-actinin interaction plays a pivotal role in receptor internalization and function. Overall, our results suggest that the interplay of A2AR with calmodulin and α-actinin 1 is fine-tuned by Ca2+, a fact that might power agonist-mediated receptor internalization and function."

In this study we used a stochastic network-based disease spread model to better understand the role of vessel movements and nearby seaway distance on PD spread in marine farms. We used five different edge's definitions and weights for the network construction: high-risk vessel movements, high-risk wellboat movements and high-risk nearby seaway distance at <20 km, <10 km or <5 km, respectively. Models were used to simulate PD spread in marine farms as well as to simulate the spread of marine SAV2 and SAV3 subtypes independently and results were compared with the observed PD, marine SAV2 and SAV3 cases in Norway in 2016. Results revealed that the model that provided the best fit of the observed data and, therefore, the one considered more biologically plausible, was the one using high-risk wellboat movements. The marine SAV2, SAV3 and PD models using wellboat movements were able to correctly simulate the farms status (PD positive or PD negative) with the sensitivity of 84%, 85%, 84% and Specificity of 98%, 97% and 94%, respectively. These results should contribute to inform more cost-effective prevention and control policies to mitigate PD spread and to improve the sustainability and long-term profitability of the salmon industry in Norway."

These molecular species were electroblotted onto PVDF membranes, and were further characterized by amino acid composition analyses, cyanogen bromide cleavage and N-terminal analyses. The results revealed that the intermediate 'non-AA' fraction consisted of histones H2B, H3 and H4 in addition to protein AA also found in this fraction."

Volume: 52 Issue: 15 Aug 07 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29979581/,"Traces of particulate radioactive iodine (131I) were detected in the European atmosphere in January/February 2017. Concentrations of this nuclear fission product were very low, ranging 0.1 to 10 μBq m-3 except at one location in western Russia where they reached up to several mBq m-3. Detections have been reported continuously over an 8-week period by about 30 monitoring stations. We examine possible emission source apportionments and rank them considering their expected contribution in terms of orders of magnitude from typical routine releases: radiopharmaceutical production units > sewage sludge incinerators > nuclear power plants > spontaneous fission of uranium in soil. Inverse modeling simulations indicate that the widespread detections of 131I resulted from the combination of multiple source releases. Among them, those from radiopharmaceutical production units remain the most likely. One of them is located in Western Russia and its estimated source term complies with authorized limits. Other existing sources related to 131I use (medical purposes or sewage sludge incineration) can explain detections on a rather local scale. As an enhancing factor, the prevailing wintertime meteorological situations marked by strong temperature inversions led to poor dispersion conditions that resulted in higher concentrations exceeding usual detection limits in use within the informal Ring of Five (Ro5) monitoring network."

In an attempt to follow the distribution of PtdIns(3)P at the ultrastructural level, we are using the Fab1, YOTB, Vac1, and EEA1 (FYVE) domain, which is a zinc finger motif specifically binding to PtdIns(3)P. To follow PtdIns(3)P trafficking during a defined time window, here we have used a monomeric dimerizable FYVE probe, which binds with high avidity to PtdIns(3)P only after rapalog-induced dimerization. The probe localized to early and late endocytic compartments according to the time period of dimerization, which indicates that PtdIns(3)P is turned over via the endocytic machinery. In the functional context of epidermal growth factor (EGF) stimulation, we observed that dimerization of the probe led to clustering of mainly early endocytic structures, leaving most of the probe localized to the limiting membrane of endosomes. Interestingly, these clustered endosomes contained coats positive for the PtdIns(3)P-binding protein hepatocyte growth factor-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs), indicating that the probe did not displace Hrs binding. We conclude that the dimerizer-inducible probe is useful for the time-resolved detection of PtdIns(3)P at the ultrastructural level, but its effects on endosome morphology after EGF stimulation need to be taken into account."

To study the interplay between GH, IGF-I, and their receptors, postsmolt Atlantic salmon were studied during spring growth (January-June 2003). From January to June, fish were sampled regularly for plasma and vertebral bone. The vertebra was collected from the same anterior-posterior position. The growth hormone receptor (ghr) (There is no determined nomenclature of salmon genes but we stick to the nomenclature which is consequent for zebrafish, where all gene names are named with small letters and in italic.) expression in the vertebrae peaked in the end of February coinciding with high levels of plasma GH and IGF-I, and an increase of vertebral growth rate. From April to June, plasma IGF-I levels decreased together with ghr expression in the vertebrae, while plasma GH did not decrease. In May and June, expression of the igf-I receptor (igf-Ir) increased 4- to 5-fold, which coincided with an increase in bone density. The changes seen in gene expression of the IGF-I and GH receptors suggest that these hormones are involved in vertebral growth and bone density."

In this work, we carried out fundamental in vitro and in vivo experiments to assess the labeling efficacy of our novel theranostic nanoprobe, consisting of glycogen conjugated with a red fluorescent probe and gadolinium. Microscopy and resazurin viability assays were used to study cell labeling and cell viability in human metastatic melanoma cell lines. Fluorescence lifetime correlation spectroscopy (FLCS) was done to investigate nanoprobe stability. Magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) was performed to study T₁ relaxivity in vitro, and contrast enhancement in a subcutaneous in vivo tumor model. Efficient cell labeling was demonstrated, while cell viability, cell migration, and cell growth was not affected. FLCS showed that the nanoprobe did not degrade in blood plasma. MRI demonstrated that down to 750 cells/μL of labeled cells in agar phantoms could be detected. In vivo MRI showed that contrast enhancement in tumors was comparable between Omniscan contrast agent and the nanoprobe. In conclusion, we demonstrate for the first time that a non-toxic glycogen-based nanoprobe may effectively visualize tumor cells and tissue, and, in future experiments, we will investigate its therapeutic potential by conjugating therapeutic compounds to the nanoprobe.

Volume: 51 Issue: 3 Mar 1990,1990,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2356234/,Athymic nude mice with human tumors transplanted to one of the hind legs were given aluminium phthalocyanine disulfonate (AlPcS2) intraperitoneally. Twenty-four hours after the injection the mice were placed with the tumor in the sample position in a fluorescence spectrometer with modulated excitation. Exposure of the tumors to laser light at a fluence rate of 50-200 mW/cm2 led to a rapid transient reduction by up to 50% of the phthalocyanine fluorescence of the tumor. After the laser irradiation the fluence rate of the fluorescence increased almost up to the initial value within a few minutes. This finding should be taken into account when optimal fluence rates and dose fractionation schemes are sought for photodynamic therapy.

We hypothesized that the concentration of mtDNA might reflect inflammatory activity in multiple sclerosis and investigated therefore levels of cell-free mitochondrial DNA in cerebrospinal fluid of patients with relapsing-remitting multiple sclerosis. Significantly higher levels of mtDNA were found in patients compared to controls and there was an inverse correlation between disease duration and mtDNA concentration. Our study suggests that mitochondria can be involved early in multiple sclerosis, but whether this is as an initiator of the inflammatory response or part of its maintenance is unclear. Further, our study suggests that changes in mtDNA may provide a novel marker for early disease activity."

Pectic polysaccharides from 50% EtOH, 50°C water and 100°C water extracts from elderflowers were treated with endo-α-d-(1-4)-polygalacturonase after previous de-esterification with the intention of isolating hairy regions and relate variation in structure to immunomodulating activity. High molecular weight sub-fractions (25-29kDa) and medium molecular weight sub-fractions (6-17kDa) were isolated after enzymatic treatment in addition to oligogalacturonides. Structural elucidation indicated that RG-I regions with AG-I and AG-II sidechains were the predominant structures in the high molecular weight sub-fractions, and two of three 1,4-linked GalA units in the rhamnogalacturonan backbone were branched in either position 2 or 3. The medium molecular weight sub-fractions had monomers and linkages typical for both RG-I and RG-II. The results showed that the high molecular RG-I containing polymers exhibit the highest dose-dependent complement fixing and macrophage stimulating activities."

A set of statistical tools exists for such analysis, but their strengths and weaknesses have not been fully explored. The statistical methods we are concerned with here are mainly used to examine similarities between archaeal and bacterial DNA from different genomes. These methods compare observed genomic frequencies of fixed-sized oligonucleotides with expected values, which can be determined by genomic nucleotide content, smaller oligonucleotide frequencies, or be based on specific statistical distributions. Advantages with these statistical methods include measurements of phylogenetic relationship with relatively small pieces of DNA sampled from almost anywhere within genomes, detection of foreign/conserved DNA, and homology searches. Our aim was to explore the reliability and best suited applications for some popular methods, which include relative oligonucleotide frequencies (ROF), di- to hexanucleotide zero'th order Markov methods (ZOM) and 2.order Markov chain Method (MCM). Tests were performed on distant homology searches with large DNA sequences, detection of foreign/conserved DNA, and plasmid-host similarity comparisons. Additionally, the reliability of the methods was tested by comparing both real and random genomic DNA."

Volume: 156 Issue: 1 Jan 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25599302/,"Previous studies suggest that transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS) over the primary motor cortex (M1) reduces chronic pain levels. In this randomized controlled trial, we investigated the effects of 5 consecutive 20-minute sessions of 2-mA anodal tDCS directed to the M1 in 48 patients (45 females) with fibromyalgia. Changes in pain, stress, daily functioning, psychiatric symptoms, and health-related quality of life were measured. Pain and stress were measured 30 days before treatment, at each treatment, and 30 days after treatment by using short message service on mobile phones. Patients were randomized to the active or sham tDCS group by receiving individual treatment codes associated either with the sham or active tDCS in the stimulator. Adverse effects were registered using a standardized form. A small but significant improvement in pain was observed under the active tDCS condition but not under the sham condition. Fibromyalgia-related daily functioning improved in the active tDCS group compared with the sham group. The stimulation was well tolerated by the patients, and no significant difference in the adverse effects between the groups was observed. The results suggest that tDCS has the potential to induce statistically significant pain relief in patients with fibromyalgia, with no serious adverse effects, but small effect sizes indicate that the results are unlikely to reflect clinically important changes.

Volume: 130 Issue: 6-8,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23246917/,"The development of multi-cellular organisms involves a comprehensive and tightly regulated cell-to-cell communication system to coordinate the activity and behavior of individual cells. Diverse signaling pathways ranging from receptor-mediated signal transduction to contact-dependent communication via gap junctions achieve these complex interactions. In this review, we will focus on a new type of intercellular connection, the tunneling nanotube (TNT), which has been observed in many cell types in vitro and recently also in developing embryos of different species in vivo. We will summarize the latest insights into their functional roles in cell-to-cell signaling with a particular focus on the TNT-dependent electrical coupling between developing embryonic cells. Finally, potential implications of these new findings in the light of developmental processes, particularly in cell migration, will be discussed."

Volume: 374 Issue: 2061 Feb 28 2016",2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26755764/,"Photomicrobial fuel cells (p-MFCs) are devices that use photosynthetic organisms (such as cyanobacteria or algae) to turn light energy into electrical energy. In a p-MFC, the anode accepts electrons from microorganisms that are either growing directly on the anode surface (biofilm) or are free floating in solution (planktonic). The nature of both the anode and cathode material is critical for device efficiency. An ideal anode is biocompatible and facilitates direct electron transfer from the microorganisms, with no need for an electron mediator. For a p-MFC, there is the additional requirement that the anode should not prevent light from perfusing through the photosynthetic cells. The cathode should facilitate the rapid reaction of protons and oxygen to form water so as not to rate limit the device. In this paper, we first review the range of anode and cathode materials currently used in p-MFCs. We then present our own data comparing cathode materials in a p-MFC and our first results using porous ceramic anodes in a mediator-free p-MFC. "

Volume: 127 Issue: 2 Feb 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20136197/,"A set of critical conditions for the characteristic caustic points in the phonon focusing patterns in tetragonal crystals is formulated. A caustic line segment in the focusing pattern is generally associated with either a fold or a cusp on the wave surface. Most of the caustic lines are symmetrical with respect to the principal symmetry plane and can be characterized by the caustic points at the centers of the caustic lines. These characteristic caustic points originated from inflection/parabolic points with zero in-plane/ex-plane curvature, respectively. By employing the Stroh formalism, the inflection/parabolic points on the slowness surface are studied in terms of the so-called zero-curvature transonic states. Since these transonic states are related to extraordinary degeneracies in the Stroh eigenvalue equation, the conditions for the degeneracies can be regarded as critical conditions for the characteristic caustic points. These conditions provide an overview of global structure of the phonon focusing patterns in tetragonal crystals. A set of caustic lines in vicinity of (001) plane is also investigated and exemplified."

Volume: 74 Issue: 7-9 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21391096/,"Effluent from oil production activities contains chemicals that are suspected of inducing endocrine disruption in fish. In this study, Atlantic cod (Gadus morhua L.) were exposed to mixtures of low- and medium-molecular-weight alkylphenols (AP) (methyl- to heptylphenol), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH), diluted produced water, and dispersed oil for 15 d in a flow-through exposure system. Condition index (CI), hepatosomatic index (HSI), gonadosomatic index (GSI), concentration of the estrogenic biomarker vitellogenin (Vtg), and modulation of the total sex steroid-binding capacity in plasma were determined to assess whether these mixtures were capable of interfering with endocrine-regulated physiological processes in Atlantic cod. No marked differences in plasma Vtg levels were found between control and exposed groups of either males or females, possibly due to high intergroup variances and low sample numbers. An apparent numerical increase in the number of male and female fish with high plasma Vtg levels was, however, observed in some exposure groups compared to control. This purported weak estrogenic effect was several orders of magnitude lower than that observed for potent estrogens and suggested that the levels of estrogen receptor (ER) agonists were low. Exposure of female fish to a mixture of dispersed oil and a mixture of AP, PAH, and dispersed oil led to upregulation of the plasma total sex steroid-binding capacity, indicating interference with the normal blood steroid transport. No significant effects were seen for CI, HSI, and GSI, suggesting that the endocrine-disrupting potential was not sufficient to elicit effects on general physiological conditions and gonad development during this short exposure period."

There was a trend that patients with delusions of jealousy did better on course variables, but similar outcomes were revealed in groups with delusions of jealousy, persecution and a mixed group with different main delusions. Duration of symptoms prior to admission was a significant predictor of outcome, indicating dividing lines of 1 and 6 months at 10-year follow-up and 3 and 6 months at long-term follow-up. Based on the data, a minimal duration of 6 months is proposed for persistent delusional disorder."

In this study we investigated associations between cannabis use and brain structures among patients with schizophrenia or bipolar disorders. Magnetic resonance imaging scans were obtained for 77 schizophrenia and 55 bipolar patients with a history of cannabis use (defined as lifetime use >10 times during one month or abuse/dependence), and 97 schizophrenia, 85 bipolar disorder patients and 277 healthy controls without any previous cannabis use. Cortical thickness, cortical surface area and subcortical volumes were compared between groups. Both hypothesis-driven region-of-interest analyses from 11 preselected brain regions in each hemisphere and exploratory point-by-point analyses were performed. We tested for diagnostic interactions and controlled for potential confounders. After controlling for confounders such as tobacco use and alcohol use disorders we found reduced cortical thickness in the caudal middle frontal gyrus compared to non-user patients and healthy controls. The findings were not significant when patients with co-morbid alcohol and illicit drug use were excluded from the analyses, but onset of cannabis use before illness onset was associated with cortical thinning in the caudal middle frontal gyrus. To conclude, we found no structural brain changes associated with cannabis use among patients with severe mental illness, but the findings indicate excess cortical thinning among those who use cannabis before illness onset. The present findings support the understanding that cannabis use is associated with limited brain effects in schizophrenia as well as bipolar disorder."

This study focuses on a reconstruction and prediction for China of long-term emission trends of intentionally and unintentionally produced (UP) ∑7PCBs (UP-PCBs, from the manufacture of steel, cement and sinter iron) and their re-emissions from secondary sources (e.g., soils and vegetation) using a dynamic fate model (BETR-Global). Contemporary emission estimates combined with predictions from the multimedia fate model suggest that primary sources still dominate, although unintentional sources are predicted to become a main contributor from 2035 for PCB-28. Imported e-waste is predicted to play an increasing role until 2020-2030 on a national scale due to the decline of intentionally produced (IP) emissions. Hypothetical emission scenarios suggest that China could become a potential source to neighboring regions with a net output of ∼0.4 t year-1 by around 2050. However, future emission scenarios and hence model results will be dictated by the efficiency of control measures."

Volume: 91 Issue: 2 Feb 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27714423/,"Endocrine disruption is a specific form of toxicity, where natural and/or anthropogenic chemicals, known as ""endocrine disruptors"" (EDs), trigger adverse health effects by disrupting the endogenous hormone system. There is need to harmonize guidance on the regulation of EDs, but this has been hampered by what appeared as a lack of consensus among scientists. This publication provides summary information about a consensus reached by a group of world-leading scientists that can serve as the basis for the development of ED criteria in relevant EU legislation. Twenty-three international scientists from different disciplines discussed principles and open questions on ED identification as outlined in a draft consensus paper at an expert meeting hosted by the German Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) in Berlin, Germany on 11-12 April 2016. Participants reached a consensus regarding scientific principles for the identification of EDs. The paper discusses the consensus reached on background, definition of an ED and related concepts, sources of uncertainty, scientific principles important for ED identification, and research needs. It highlights the difficulty in retrospectively reconstructing ED exposure, insufficient range of validated test systems for EDs, and some issues impacting on the evaluation of the risk from EDs, such as non-monotonic dose-response and thresholds, modes of action, and exposure assessment. This report provides the consensus statement on EDs agreed among all participating scientists. The meeting facilitated a productive debate and reduced a number of differences in views. It is expected that the consensus reached will serve as an important basis for the development of regulatory ED criteria."

With Co(OH)x decoration, a photocurrent density as high as 2.3 mA cm-2 (1.23 V vs. NHE) was reached under AM1.5G simulated solar light; however, the electrode suffered from photocorrosion. More stable photoelectrochemical (PEC) performance was achieved by first loading Co(OH)x, followed by loading cobalt phosphate (Co-Pi) as double co-catalysts. The Co(OH)x/Co-Pi double co-catalysts may act as a hole storage layer that slows down the photocorrosion caused by the accumulated holes on the surface of the electrode. A ""waggling"" appearance close to the ""mouth"" of Ta2O5 NTs was observed, and may indicate structural instability of the ""mouth"" region, which breaks into segments after nitridation and forms a top layer of broken Ta3N5 NTs. A unique mesoporous structure of the walls of the Ta3N5 NTs, which is reported here the first time, is also a result of the nitridation process. We believe that the mesoporous structure makes it difficult for the nanotubes to be fully covered by the co-catalyst layer, hence rationalizing the remaining degradation by photocorrosion."

Volume: 31 Suppl 2 Nov 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17968433/,"In Western countries, more women than men die every year of cardiovascular disease (CVD) and women spend more life years with cardiovascular disease than men. Fortunately, premature cardiovascular disease in women is preventable. Evidence-based guidelines for the prevention of cardiovascular disease in women recommend an initial risk assessment. However, recommended risk-assessment tools such as the Systematic Coronary Risk Evaluation (SCORE) system may not be sufficient to detect risk in women with obesity. A further barrier to prevention in women is the fact that physicians may underestimate the effects of risk factors that are particularly dangerous or prevalent in women. These include type 2 diabetes, hypertension, smoking, abdominal obesity, poor exercise capacity and the metabolic syndrome. Several of these factors, as well as some novel biomarkers, may increase the risk of cardiovascular disease relatively more in women than in men. To assess risk in obese women, a multifactorial assessment that encompasses assessment of body-fat distribution should be undertaken. Weight loss and lifestyle changes that have been shown to improve risk-factor profiles are crucial interventions and should be considered, even if standard risk calculators do not indicate an elevated cardiovascular risk."

The predictive power increases when more spectral variables are combined, but the complex information can be difficult to handle during the intensity of CPR. We therefore developed a method for expressing this multidimensional information in a single reproducible variable reflecting the probability of defibrillation success. This is based on the highest performing predictor for ROSC after 883 shocks given to 156 patients with VF. This was a combination of two decorrelated spectral features based on a principal component analysis of an original feature set with information on centroid frequency, peak power frequency, spectral flatness and energy. The function ""Probability of defibrillation success"" (P(ROSC)(v)) was developed by a 2-dimensional histogram technique. P(ROSC)(v) discriminated between shocks followed by ROSC and No-ROSC (P<0.0001). The present methodology indicates a possible way to develop a CPR monitor."

Volume: 24 Issue: 9 Sep 1994,1994,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7810175/,"1. In the liver of rat fed a single dose of 3-thia fatty acids, 3-dithiahexadecanedioic acid (3-thiadicarboxylic acid) and tetradecylthioacetic acid, steady-state levels of P4504A1 and fatty acyl-CoA oxidase mRNAs increased in parallel. The increases were significant 8 h after administration, reaching a maximum after 12 h and decreased from 12 to 24 h after administration. 2. The corresponding enzyme activities of P4504A1 and fatty acyl-CoA oxidase were also induced in a parallel manner by the 3-thia fatty acids. The enzyme activities were significantly increased 12 h after administration and increased further after 24 h. This may reflect a possible effect of the 3-thia fatty acids not only on mRNA levels, but also on the translation and degradation rate of the two enzymes. 3. Repeated administration of 3-thia fatty acids resulted in an increase of the specific P4504A1 protein accompanied with an increased lauric acid hydroxylase activity. The correlation between induction of P4504A1 and fatty acyl-CoA oxidase mRNAs and their enzyme activities may reflect a coordinated rather than a causative induction mechanism, and that these genes respond to a common signal. This suggests that the increased P450 activity may not be responsible or be a prerequisite for fatty acyl-CoA oxidase induction. 4. Since the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor (PPAR) plays a role in mediating the induction of fatty acyl-CoA oxidase, we analysed the activation of PPAR by fatty acids and sulphur-substituted analogues utilizing a chimera between the N-terminal and DNA-binding domain of the glucocorticoid receptor and the putative ligand-binding domain of PPAR. Arachidonic acid activated this chimeric receptor in Chinese hamster ovary cells. Inhibitors of P450 did not affect the activation of PPAR by arachidonic acid. Furthermore, dicarboxylic acids including 1,12-dodecanedioic acid or 1,16-hexadecanedioic acid only weakly activated the chimera. 3-Thidicarboxylic acid, however, was a much more effective activator than the non-sulphur-substituted analogues. In conclusion, the data suggest that the most likely mechanism of the induction process is fatty acid-induced activation of PPAR, which then leads to a coordinated induction of P4504A1 and fatty acyl-CoA oxidase."

Volume: 146 Issue: 4 Dec 1992,1992,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1362854/,"We have investigated the modulation of different G protein alpha- and beta-subunit levels in prolactin (PRL) and growth hormone producing rat pituitary adenoma cells (GH3 cells) in culture after prolonged exposure (6-48 h) to the steroid hormones 17 beta-oestradiol and dexamethasone. Gi-3 alpha- and G beta-subunits were the only G protein subunits which increased in response to 10(-6) M oestradiol (to approximately 150 and 200% of controls, respectively), while the other alpha-subunits investigated (Gs alpha, Gi-2 alpha and G(o) alpha) remained relatively unchanged. Thyroliberin (TRH)--and guanosine 5'-[beta gamma-imido]trisphosphate (Gpp(NH)p)-elicited adenylyl cyclase (AC) activities were reduced during 6-12 h of oestradiol treatment (by 60 and 20%, respectively), while the inhibitory effect of somatostatin (SRIF) increased by approximately 100%. Dexamethasone (10(-6) M) increased levels of the stimulatory G protein Gs alpha (to approximately 340%) and decreased levels of Gi-3 alpha (to 25%). After 48 h, the AC response to TRH was reduced by approximately 70%, whereas the effect of the other modulators remained close to controls. We conclude that G protein subunits in GH3 cells are subject to specific regulation by steroid hormones and that this may be important in the tuning of the responsiveness of PRL secretion to hormones in the in vivo situation."

Volume: 78 Issue: 930 Jun 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15900058/,"In radiotherapy planning systems, delineation of hollow normal tissue organs, such as the bladder, is time-consuming. Automated delineation may presuppose two assumptions: (1) the bladder resembles a spherical shell and (2) the volume of bladder tissue is preserved regardless of the volume of urine (luminal volume) inside. The purpose of the present study was to test these assumptions. 22 CT scans from 7 patients were studied retrospectively. Transverse cross-sectional areas enclosed by the outer contour (A(out)) and inner contour of the bladder (A(in)) were recorded from the images. Hence, the transverse cross-sectional area of the wall, A(wall)=A(out)-A(in), and the volume of bladder tissue at various luminal volumes, could be calculated. To quantify the method uncertainty, the same procedure was applied on three spherical plastic phantoms. The results were also compared with data from the Visible Human Project's photographs of cadaver cryo-sections. Assumption no. 1 stated above, implies that A(wall) is constant regardless of the level of intersection of the sphere. The data from cryo-sections revealed a positive correlation for A(wall) and A(out), in contradiction to assumption no. 1 (p<0.001). The corresponding association derived from the repetitive CT scans of patients was also statistically significant (p<0.001) although linear regression revealed a less steep slope. A relationship was found between the volume of bladder tissue and luminal volume, hence contradicting assumption no. 2 (p<0.001). In conclusion the cross-sectional wall areas of the bladder, measured from patient CT scans, increase slightly with luminal cross-sectional areas in contradiction to expected values derived from a simplistic spherical shell model. In addition, the volume of bladder tissue is related to the luminal volume. Our results may be of practical value when developing automated delineation tools in radiotherapy planning systems."

One of the patients developed autoantibodies targeting the collecting duct-specific water channel aquaporin 2, whereas autoantibodies of the two other patients reacted against the HOXB7 or NFAT5 transcription factors, which regulate the aquaporin 2 promoter. Our findings suggest that tubulointerstitial nephritis developed in these patients as a result of an autoimmune insult on the kidney collecting duct cells."

The CD1w2(+) (CD1b-like) molecules were present on distinct cells that were scattered evenly through the dermis, whereas CD1w3(+) (CD1c-like) molecules were almost exclusively detected on or in close association with the vascular endothelium. There was a significant increase in the presence of MHC-DQ(+) cells in the superficial dermis of dinitrochlorobenzene-treated animals compared with both an untreated control group and a vehicle-treated control group. However, MHC-DQ/DR(+) and CD1w3(+) cells only showed a significant increase compared with the vehicle-treated control group. The present study shows that the distribution of molecules involved in antigen presentation to CD4(+) T-cells and gammadelta T-cells changes during the elicitation phase of CHS in sheep, and suggests a role for MHC-DQ molecules on antigen presenting cells. However, the changes in distribution and expression of MHC-II and CD1 subtypes argue against a prominent role for a CD1-dependent pathway for T-cell recognition in the clinical cutaneous hypersensitivity response in sheep. Based on the expression of MHC-II molecules and CD1c molecules, we also suggest a potential role for endothelial cells in antigen presentation during the clinical dermatitis reaction."

Volume: 130 Issue: 11 Nov 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11053525/,"To improve the formulation of diets for the early stages of marine fish, assimilation rates of free amino acids (FAA) and protein in postlarval Senegal sole (Solea senegalensis) were determined. Fish (2.45 +/- 0.87 mg dry weight) were tube fed 36 nL of a diet of FAA containing L-[(35)S] methionine (FAA diet) or bovine serum albumin, containing L-[methylated-(14)C]bovine serum albumin (Prot-diet), both at a concentration of 4.08 g/L. A time series was performed, and the amounts of label in incubation water, liver, gut and body carcass were quantified. The FAA diet was absorbed with a 3.5-times-higher transfer rate (P < 0.001) from the gut into the larval body tissues compared with the Prot-diet. The FAA diet also was assimilated with greater efficiency than the Prot-diet (80% versus 58%, P: = 0.001). If we assume that the label present in the gut represents amino acids incorporated into the intestinal tissue, the assimilation efficiencies for the two diets were 89 and 64%. Therefore, FAA seems to be superior to protein as a dietary source of amino acids in Senegal sole postlarvae. However, because the absorption dynamics of protein and FAA differ, care should be taken when using the sources together to avoid amino acid imbalance."

550,Sensual and sexual marital contentment in parents of small children--a follow-up study when the first child is four years old.,18686158,Journal of sex research. Volume: 45 Issue: 3,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18686158/,"This follow-up study explored parents' (N=452) intimate relationships when their firstborn child was 6 months old and then 4 years later. The measurement used was a modified version of the Dyadic Adjustment Scale, DAS. The present results show that most parents responding were content sensually at 6 months postpartum in 2002 and 4 years later, in 2006. More parents had changed from being sensually content in 2002 to discontent in 2006, than the contrary, however, and the sexual contentment remained low. The average sexual frequency was low both at 6 months and at 4 years for both parents with and without additional children. Experiencing tiredness as a hindrance to having sex was perceived as a greater problem among those parents without additional children. Prospective regression analyses indicated that sexuality was significantly related to both sensual and sexual contentment 4 years later. Sexuality was also one of the most significant covariates in the cross-sectional regression analysis for sensual contentment. Since sexuality plays a central role in partner well-being, it may be an important target for helping parents with small children."

Volume: 147 09 16 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27268957/,"The rapidly growing aquaculture industry drives the search for sustainable protein sources in fish feed. In the European Union (EU) since 2013 non-ruminant processed animal proteins (PAP) are again permitted to be used in aquafeeds. To ensure that commercial fish feeds do not contain PAP from prohibited species, EU reference methods were established. However, due to the heterogeneous and complex nature of PAP complementary methods are required to guarantee the safe use of this fish feed ingredient. In addition, there is a need for tissue specific PAP detection to identify the sources (i.e. bovine carcass, blood, or meat) of illegal PAP use. In the present study, we investigated and compared different protein extraction, solubilisation and digestion protocols on different proteomics platforms for the detection and differentiation of prohibited PAP. In addition, we assessed if tissue specific PAP detection was feasible using proteomics tools. All work was performed independently in two different laboratories. We found that irrespective of sample preparation gel-based proteomics tools were inappropriate when working with PAP. Gel-free shotgun proteomics approaches in combination with direct spectral comparison were able to provide quality species and tissue specific data to complement and refine current methods of PAP detection and identification."

The overall whelping rate was 70% and mean (+/- SEM) litter size was 5.3 +/- 0.2 pups. The whelping rate was higher after intrauterine insemination (71%; n = 305) than after intravaginal insemination (29%; n = 7; P < 0.05). Timing of insemination was crucial; timing classified as optimal resulted in a higher whelping rate and larger litter size (P < 0.05) than did timing classified as early, late or too late. In the too late category, none of the bitches (n = 5) whelped. For optimal timing, whelping rate and mean (+/- SEM) litter size were 76% (n = 252) and 5.6 +/- 0.2, for early 33% (n = 6) and 1.5 +/- 0.5, and for late 47% (n = 19) and 2.8 +/- 0.7. Two inseminations yielded a higher whelping rate (P < 0.05) and greater mean litter size (P < 0.05) than that of one insemination, 77% and 5.6 +/- 0.3, and 60% and 4.6 +/- 0.3, respectively. However, the results obtained after one insemination were poorer partly because of an over-representation of late insemination in this group. Semen classified as of poor quality (progressive motility < 50% or percentage of abnormal spermatozoa > 20%) gave a lower whelping rate (53%) than did semen of medium (progressive motility = 50%) or good quality (progressive motility > 50% and percentage of abnormal spermatozoa < 20%), which gave whelping rates of 76 and 74%, respectively (P < 0.05). The mean litter sizes were not significantly different. Eighty-two per cent of bitches (120 of 147) inseminated twice into the uterus at a time classified as optimal with frozen semen of good or medium quality whelped. The mean (+/- SEM) litter size was 5.6 +/- 0.3 pups in this group. These results show the potential of transcervical intrauterine insemination for routine artificial insemination in dogs."

Patients were randomized to either an exercise group (n = 40) or a control group (n = 40). The mean ejection fractions at baseline were 31 +/- 8% in the exercise group and 31 +/- 1% in the control group. The exercise group exercised twice a week for 4 months in addition to 4 consultations with a CHF nurse. Six-minute walking distance, workload and exercise time on a cycle ergometer test, and the quality of life were measured at baseline and 4 and 12 months after enrollment. After 4 months, functional capacity (6-minute walking distance +58 vs -15 m, p <0.001) and the quality of life (Minnesota Living With Heart Failure Questionnaire score +10 vs -1 point, p <0.005) improved significantly in the exercise group compared with the control group. After 12 months, the improvements were still significant in the exercise group compared with the control group for all parameters (6-minute walking distance +41 vs -20 m, p <0.001; workload +10 vs -1 W, p = 0.001; exercise time +53 vs -6 seconds, p = 0.003; quality of life +10 vs -6 points, p = 0.003). In conclusion, the results support the implementation of a group-based aerobic interval training program to improve long-term effects on functional capacity and the quality of life in patients with CHF."

Blood glucose was measured before and at 10, 20 and 30 min after injection of the anaesthetic agents. At 30 min the rats were sacrificed, and blood was drawn for measurement of glucagon and insulin. Pre-anaesthetic values for insulin and glucagon were established in separate groups of fasted and fed rats. In fasting rats given Hypnorm, blood glucose and plasma insulin were unchanged while there was a non-significant increase in plasma glucagon. The fasted rats given Pentobarbital had unchanged blood glucose and plasma insulin and a non-significant depression of glucagon. The fed rats given Hypnorm had a significant increase in blood glucose at 10 min and nearly a doubling of glucose values at 20 and 30 min (P < 0.001). Glucagon increased far less than in the fasted group, whereas insulin was doubled from preanaesthetic values (P < 0.05). The fed rats given Pentobarbital, had unchanged blood glucose, a slight non-significant depression of glucagon and a significant increase in insulin (P < 0.01). Thus Hypnorm induced hyperglycaemia in fed but not in fasted rats, probably because more glucose was available in the fed state. Fed animals are a modification of the standard fasted animal model, and may be preferable when exploring hyperglycaemic or other reactions to anaesthetic agents."

Volume: 10 Issue: 9 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26375388/,"Phage vB_Tsc2631 infects the extremophilic bacterium Thermus scotoductus MAT2631 and uses the Ts2631 endolysin for the release of its progeny. The Ts2631 endolysin is the first endolysin from thermophilic bacteriophage with an experimentally validated catalytic site. In silico analysis and computational modelling of the Ts2631 endolysin structure revealed a conserved Zn2+ binding site (His30, Tyr58, His131 and Cys139) similar to Zn2+ binding site of eukaryotic peptidoglycan recognition proteins (PGRPs). We have shown that the Ts2631 endolysin lytic activity is dependent on divalent metal ions (Zn2+ and Ca2+). The Ts2631 endolysin substitution variants H30N, Y58F, H131N and C139S dramatically lost their antimicrobial activity, providing evidence for the role of the aforementioned residues in the lytic activity of the enzyme. The enzyme has proven to be not only thermoresistant, retaining 64.8% of its initial activity after 2 h at 95°C, but also highly thermodynamically stable (Tm = 99.82°C, ΔHcal = 4.58 × 10(4) cal mol(-1)). Substitutions of histidine residues (H30N and H131N) and a cysteine residue (C139S) resulted in variants aggregating at temperatures ≥75°C, indicating a significant role of these residues in enzyme thermostability. The substrate spectrum of the Ts2631 endolysin included extremophiles of the genus Thermus but also Gram-negative mesophiles, such as Escherichia coli, Salmonella panama, Pseudomonas fluorescens and Serratia marcescens. The broad substrate spectrum and high thermostability of this endolysin makes it a good candidate for use as an antimicrobial agent to combat Gram-negative pathogens."

Parental interview was performed and serum was collected from a total of 245 children (207 children aged 24-41 months and 76 children aged 0-23 months) with no history of lower respiratory disease. Repeated serum samples were obtained in 38 subjects. Ten percent of the children had active eczema at examination. All children were controls in the ""Environment and Childhood Asthma"" study in Oslo. Geometric means (GM +/- 1.96 SD) for serum ECP were 11.8 microg/l (2.5-56.0) and 7.9 microg/l (2.0-30.4), respectively, in the 0-23 and 24-41-month-old children, with the corresponding values for serum MPO 453 microg/l (153-1349) and 347 microg/l (142-859), respectively. Age was inversely associated with serum-ECP and serum-MPO, most pronounced in the youngest children. Active eczema and maternal daily smoking adversely affected serum-ECP, but not serum-MPO. Gender and parental atopy did not influence the results. We conclude that serum-ECP in very young children is influenced by age and active eczema and is related to maternal smoking in a dose-dependent fashion. These factors should be considered when assessing inflammatory markers in very young children."

After the first dose, 7 patients experienced moderate fever (< 39 degrees C), 5 patients had high fever (> 39 degrees C), 4 patients had nausea/vomiting, 3 diarrhea, 1 headache, and 1 hypertension. These reactions were seen only after the first dose except for 1 patient who developed urticaria on days 3-4. All the rejection episodes were reversed or partially reversed. Twenty-one patients experienced re-rejections 3-46 days after the last BMA 031 dose, and were treated with methylprednisolone and/or rabbit antihuman thymocyte globulin. Seven patients lost their grafts within 1 year (28%), including 2 patients who died of infection with a functioning graft. BMA 031 seems to be a safe drug with only few mild side effects, and it effectively reverses steroid-resistant rejections. Re-rejections were frequent, but mostly reversible."

All 3 methods have shown that the EEG in schizophrenia patients is characterized by enhanced low-frequency (delta and theta) and high-frequency (beta) activity in comparison with the control group. However, the spatial pattern of differences was dependent on the type of method used. Comparative analysis has shown that increased EEG power in schizophrenia patients apparently concerns both widely spatially distributed components and local components of signal. Furthermore, the observed differences in the delta and theta range can be described mainly by the local components, and those in the beta range mostly by spatially widely distributed ones. The possible nature of the widely distributed activity is discussed."

However, moderating factors of such associations are less studied. In this cross-sectional population-based controlled study we examined the moderating effects of a history of parental cancer on the association between impaired health status in parents and psychosocial problems among their teenagers. Among families with both parents responding to the adult Health Survey of Nord-Trøndelag County of Norway (the HUNT-2 study) 71 couples were identified with primary invasive cancer in one parent. Their 81 teenage children took part in the Young-HUNT study. These families were compared to 322 cancer-free families with 328 teenagers. Based on self-report data the relations between three variables of parental impaired health and six psychosocial problems in teenagers were analyzed family wise by structural equation modeling. Significant associations between parental and teenagers' variables were observed in eight of 18 models. A history of parental cancer was a significant moderator which decreased four of eight significant associations. Such a history significantly weakened the associations between parental poor self-rated health and teenagers' anxiety/depression and school problems. A similar association of a history of parental cancer was found between psychological distress in parents and teenagers' feelings of loneliness and poor self-rated health. This study confirmed strong associations between impaired parental health and psychosocial problems in their teenagers. A history of parental cancer weakened several of the significant associations between parental impaired health variables and psychosocial problems in their teenagers. "

The highest density of cells was observed along the major curvature of the antrum pyloricum. Here they were located in the bottom half of the gastric glands. Many of the cells showed a process extending towards the glandular lumen. No significant staining in the epithelium appeared when the antiserum was preincubated with glutaraldehyde-GABA complexes, nor when the anti-GABA serum was exchanged with anti-glycine or preimmune serum. The present findings and previous physiological data suggest that GABA may play a role in gut endocrine regulation."

Volume: 263 Issue: 1 Sep 16 1999,1999,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10486270/,"Treatment with double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) has been shown to interfere with the function of specific genes in various invertebrate species. However, it has not yet been reported that this technique can be applied to vertebrates as well. We have investigated whether dsRNA treatment will inhibit gene function in zebrafish embryos. By microinjecting dsRNA corresponding to three genetically characterised genes we produced embryonic defects that were similar to the known mutant phenotypes of these loci. The efficiency of inducing specific defects (20-30%) was about 10-fold higher than in experiments with antisense RNA. We also observed that the level of the endogenous mRNA in zebrafish embryos was substantially reduced throughout the embryo following dsRNA injection. However, the interference of gene function showed a strong dependence on the amount of dsRNA. These findings suggest that dsRNA-mediated interference will become an important tool for analysing the functional roles of genes in zebrafish and other vertebrates."
577,Macrophages modulate migration and invasion of human tongue squamous cell carcinoma.,25811194,PloS one. Volume: 10 Issue: 3 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25811194/,"Oral tongue squamous cell carcinoma (OTSCC) has a high mortality rate and the incidence is rising worldwide. Despite advances in treatment, the disease lacks specific prognostic markers and treatment modality. The spreading of OTSCC is dependent on the tumor microenvironment and involves tumor-associated macrophages (TAMs). Although the presence of TAMs is associated with poor prognosis in OTSCC, the specific mechanisms underlying this are still unknown. The aim here was to investigate the effect of macrophages (Mfs) on HSC-3 tongue carcinoma cells and NF-kappaB activity. We polarized THP-1 cells to M1 (inflammatory), M2 (TAM-like) and R848 (imidazoquinoline-treated) type Mfs. We then investigated the effect of Mfs on HSC-3 cell migration and NF-kappaB activity, cytokine production and invasion using several different in vitro migration models, a human 3D tissue invasion model, antibody arrays, confocal microscopy, immunohistochemistry and a mouse invasion model. We found that in co-culture studies all types of Mfs fused with HSC-3 cells, a process which was partially due to efferocytosis. HSC-3 cells induced expression of epidermal growth factor and transforming growth factor-beta in co-cultures with M2 Mfs. Direct cell-cell contact between M2 Mfs and HSC-3 cells induced migration and invasion of HSC-3 cells while M1 Mfs reduced HSC-3 cell invasion. M2 Mfs had an excess of NF-kappaB p50 subunit and a lack of p65 subunits both in the presence and absence of HSC-3 cells, indicating dysregulation and pro-tumorigenic NF-kappaB activation. TAM-like cells were abundantly present in close vicinity to carcinoma cells in OTSCC patient samples. We conclude that M2 Mfs/TAMs have an important role in OTSCC regulating adhesion, migration, invasion and cytokine production of carcinoma cells favouring tumor growth. These results demonstrate that OTSCC patients could benefit from therapies targeting TAMs, polarizing TAM-like M2 Mfs to inflammatory macrophages and modulating NF-kappaB activity. "

The analyses were performed at the individual level and comprised qPCR and histopathological examination of 397 salmon from 25 farms along the Norwegian coast. The samples were collected in 2009 and 2010, 5-22 months post-sea transfer. The study documented multiple causes of myocarditis and revealed co-infections including individual fish infected with all four viruses. There was an overall correlation between lesions characteristic of CMS and PD and the presence of PMCV and SAV, respectively. Although PRV was ubiquitously present, high viral loads were with a few exceptions, correlated with lesions characteristic of HSMI. ASCV did not seem to have any impact on myocardial infection by PMCV, SAV or PRV. qPCR indicated a negative correlation between PMCV and SAV viral loads. Co-infections result in mixed and atypical pathological changes which pose a challenge for disease diagnostic work."

Volume: 27 Issue: 2 Feb 06 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29414686/,"The role of tryptophan-kynurenine metabolism in psychiatric disease is well established, but remains less explored in peripheral tissues. Exercise training activates kynurenine biotransformation in skeletal muscle, which protects from neuroinflammation and leads to peripheral kynurenic acid accumulation. Here we show that kynurenic acid increases energy utilization by activating G protein-coupled receptor Gpr35, which stimulates lipid metabolism, thermogenic, and anti-inflammatory gene expression in adipose tissue. This suppresses weight gain in animals fed a high-fat diet and improves glucose tolerance. Kynurenic acid and Gpr35 enhance Pgc-1α1 expression and cellular respiration, and increase the levels of Rgs14 in adipocytes, which leads to enhanced beta-adrenergic receptor signaling. Conversely, genetic deletion of Gpr35 causes progressive weight gain and glucose intolerance, and sensitizes to the effects of high-fat diets. Finally, exercise-induced adipose tissue browning is compromised in Gpr35 knockout animals. This work uncovers kynurenine metabolism as a pathway with therapeutic potential to control energy homeostasis."

Eleven volunteer male subjects completed a 90-120-min protocol in cold environments, consisting of rest, moderate and hard work. Biomedical data were measured using a smart jacket with integrated temperature, humidity and activity sensors, in addition to a custom-made sensor belt worn around the chest. Other relevant sensor data were measured using commercially available sensors. The study aimed to improve decision support for workers in cold climates, by taking advantage of the information provided by data from the rapidly growing market of wearable sensors. Important findings were that the subjective thermal sensation did not correspond to the measured absolute skin temperature and that large differences were observed in both metabolic energy production and skin temperatures under identical exposure conditions. Temperature, humidity, activity and heart rate were found to be relevant parameters for cold stress assessment, and the locations of the sensors in the prototype jacket were adequate. The study reveals the need for cold stress assessment and indicates that a generalised approached is not sufficient to assess the stress on an individual level."

Volume: 74 Issue: 17 Sep 01 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25005896/,"Many patients with glioma harbor specific mutations in the isocitrate dehydrogenase gene IDH1 that associate with a relatively better prognosis. IDH1-mutated tumors produce the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate. Because IDH1 also regulates several pathways leading to lipid synthesis, we hypothesized that IDH1-mutant tumors have an altered phospholipid metabolite profile that would impinge on tumor pathobiology. To investigate this hypothesis, we performed (31)P-MRS imaging in mouse xenograft models of four human gliomas, one of which harbored the IDH1-R132H mutation. (31)P-MR spectra from the IDH1-mutant tumor displayed a pattern distinct from that of the three IDH1 wild-type tumors, characterized by decreased levels of phosphoethanolamine and increased levels of glycerophosphocholine. This spectral profile was confirmed by ex vivo analysis of tumor extracts, and it was also observed in human surgical biopsies of IDH1-mutated tumors by (31)P high-resolution magic angle spinning spectroscopy. The specificity of this profile for the IDH1-R132H mutation was established by in vitro (31)P-NMR of extracts of cells overexpressing IDH1 or IDH1-R132H. Overall, our results provide evidence that the IDH1-R132H mutation alters phospholipid metabolism in gliomas involving phosphoethanolamine and glycerophosphocholine. These new noninvasive biomarkers can assist in the identification of the mutation and in research toward novel treatments that target aberrant metabolism in IDH1-mutant glioma."
588,Evolution and possible storage of information in a magnetite system of significance for brain development.,21440376,Medical hypotheses. Volume: 76 Issue: 6 Jun 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21440376/,"The initial evolutionary electromagnetic steps in the history of brain development are still unknown, although such knowledge might be of high relevance in understanding human degenerative diseases. All prokaryote organisms, one-celled or multicellular, must have an inherited system to process and store information activating instincts and reflexes, in order to give a quick response to external stimuli. We argue that magnetite is an obvious compound to be evaluated as an initial precursor from prebiotic Earth history in the evolution of such a system. Magnetite is a stable ferrimagnetic compound, present in organisms ranging from bacteria to humans. It occurred naturally in the early Earth environment and was later synthesized de novo in biotic organisms. We suggest that the use of magnetite has evolved to represent the main storage system for learned memory in all organisms living today."

Due to evidence of genetic overlap between BD and schizophrenia (SZ), we also genotyped these three SNPs in a Scandinavian SZ case-control sample (N = 1,073/2,919). Combining our Scandinavian samples with an Icelandic sample (N = 435 BD cases, 651 SZ cases, and 11,491 healthy controls), we found rs10994336 and rs9804190 to be nominally significantly associated with BD in this combined Nordic BD sample (N = 1,289/14,105). Nominal P was 0.015/0.018 (fixed/random effect) for rs10994336 (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.044/0.053) and 0.023 for rs9804190 (Bonferroni corrected P = 0.069). None of the SNPs were significantly associated with SZ in the combined Nordic SZ case-control sample (N = 1,724/14,410). These results further support that ANK3 is a susceptibility gene specific to BD and that more than one risk locus is involved."
591,Involvement of the pRb/p16/cdk4/cyclin D1 pathway in the tumorigenesis of sporadic malignant melanomas.,8611425,British journal of cancer. Volume: 73 Issue: 8 Apr 1996,1996,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8611425/,"Biopsies from 61 sporadic metastatic malignant melanomas and five melanoma cell lines were examined for homozygous deletions and mutations in the CDKN2 gene (p16). As the p16 protein is involved in a cell cycle regulatory pathway consisting of at least pRb, cdk4 and cyclin D1, the tumours were also screened for amplifications of the last two genes. Moreover, the transcript levels of the genes were determined and the results compared with the immunohistochemically assessed expression of pRb. Altogether, homozygous deletions of CDKN2 were found in seven tumours (11%) and two of five cell lines, whereas a mutation was detected in only one biopsy, indicating that in sporadic melanomas the former mechanism is predominant for inactivating this gene. Notably, in total 59% of the metastatic lesions lacked detectable expression of p16 mRNA, whereas all the biopsies were found to express pRb. In accordance with the postulated negative feedback loop between p16 and pRb, one melanoma cell line showed overexpression of CDKN2 mRNA together with very low levels of the Rb protein. Amplification of the other two genes may not be important in the tumorigenesis of melanomas, as only one CDK4 and no CCND1 amplification was observed. However, highly elevated CDK4 mRNA levels, compared with that seen in a panel of normal tissues, were observed in 76% of the tumours, accompanied in 71% of the cases by high expression of the CCND1 cyclin activator. Although a low frequency of CDKN2 DNA aberrations was observed, the high number of tumours that lacked CDKN2 expression but showed overexpression of CDK4 and/or CCND1, suggest that functional inactivation of pRb through this pathway may be involved in the development or progression of sporadic human melanomas."

This biomonitoring study surveys the occurrence of the metabolites from PFRs and related plasticizers (dialkyl and diaryl phosphates; DAPs) in urine from a Norwegian mother-child cohort (48 mothers and 54 children). Concentrations of DAPs were higher in the children than in their mothers (Wilcoxon signed-rank test p=0.001). Median urinary concentrations of diphenyl phosphate (DPHP) were 1.1 and 0.51ng/mL in children and mothers, respectively, followed by bis(1,3-dichloro-2-propyl) phosphate (BDCIPP) with medians of 0.23 and 0.12ng/mL, respectively. Detection frequencies for bis(2-butoxyethyl) phosphate (BBOEP) in urine from children and mothers were 32 and 1%, respectively (median<0.18ng/mL), and for di-n-butyl phosphate (DNBP) 15 and 8%, respectively (median<0.12ng/mL). The concentrations of DPHP and BDCIPP in urine from children were significantly correlated with those found for their parent compounds in air and dust from the households (Spearman's rank correlations 0.30<Rs<0.36; p<0.05). For mothers, only the urinary concentration of BDCIPP was correlated to its precursor in dust from the households (Rs=0.40; p<0.01), which might indicate higher impact of the household environment on children than mothers. A diurnal variability study of the mothers' urinary concentrations of DPHP and BDCIPP showed lower concentrations at time periods when women were likely to be outside the household. In contrast, no relevant associations between organophosphate metabolites in urine and food consumption data obtained through a 24hour recall were seen. This suggests that the residential environment is a more important exposure pathway to PFRs than the diet. "

An inherent problem in interpreting positive findings in genetic association studies of PSC is thus to distinguish between factors associated with hepatobiliary versus intestinal pathology. We aimed to clarify to what extent human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class II associations in UC patients with and without PSC differ. High-resolution DRB1 and DQB1 typing was performed in 365 Scandinavian PSC patients, an independent cohort of 330 Norwegian UC patients and 368 healthy controls. HLA associations found in PSC were mostly distinct from those seen in UC, and no significant differences were noted between PSC patients with concurrent UC and PSC patients without IBD. This suggests different HLA associated genetic susceptibility to PSC and UC, and supports notions that UC in PSC may represent a distinct UC phenotype."

The reason for this treatment failure may be the intracellular existence of the bacteria within immune cells, mainly macrophages. To investigate the effect of antibacterials on intracellular Francisella replication, we established a protocol for the detection of drugs within Atlantic cod immune cells using high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). When the uptake and intracellular concentrations of oxolinic acid and flumequine were analysed in isolated adherent head kidney leucocytes (HKLs) by HPLC, we found that uptake was rapid and the intracellular concentrations reflected the extracellular exposure concentrations. To investigate the effect of the antibacterial compounds on intracellular bacterial replication, adherent HKLs experimentally infected with the bacteria were analysed using flow cytometry and intracellular labelling of bacteria by specific antibodies. We found that flumequine did not inhibit intracellular bacterial replication. Unexpectedly, the results indicated that the intracellularly effiacy of the drug was reduced. The HPLC method used proved to be highly applicable for accurate determination of intracellular drug concentrations. When combined with sensitive and specific flow cytometry analyses for identification and measurement of intracellular bacterial replication, we suggest that this approach can be very valuable for the design of antibacterial treatments of intracellular pathogens.

Volume: 106 Issue: 37 Sep 15 2009,2009,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19717455/,"Complement component C5 is crucial for experimental animal inflammatory tissue damage; however, its involvement in human inflammation is incompletely understood. The responses to gram-negative bacteria were here studied taking advantage of human genetic complement-deficiencies--nature's own knockouts--including a previously undescribed C5 defect. Such deficiencies provide a unique tool for investigating the biological role of proteins. The experimental conditions allowed cross-talk between the different inflammatory pathways using a whole blood model based on the anticoagulant lepirudin, which does not interfere with the complement system. Expression of tissue factor, cell adhesion molecules, and oxidative burst depended highly on C5, mediated through the activation product C5a, whereas granulocyte enzyme release relied mainly on C3 and was C5a-independent. Release of cytokines and chemokines was mediated to varying degrees by complement and CD14; for example, interleukin (IL)-1beta and IL-8 were more dependent on complement than IFN-gamma and IL-6, which were highly dependent on CD14. IL-1 receptor antagonist (IL-1ra) and IFN-gamma inducible protein 10 (IP-10) were fully dependent on CD14 and inversely regulated by complement, that is, complement deficiency and complement inhibition enhanced their release. Granulocyte responses were mainly complement-dependent, whereas monocyte responses were more dependent on CD14. Notably, all responses were abolished by combined neutralization of complement and CD14. The present study provides important insight into the comprehensive role of complement in human inflammatory responses to gram-negative bacteria."

Volume: 9 Issue: 33 Sep 07 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17700872/,"The impact of X-radiation on crystalline taurine has been investigated by time resolved synchrotron X-ray powder and single crystal diffraction and Raman spectroscopy. Multiple data sets have been collected at 120 and 296 K. All the observed effects of radiation, i.e. broadening and shifts of Raman and diffraction lines, a dose dependent irreversible increase in the atomic displacement parameters (ADPs) as well as in one of the unit-cell axes, and an apparent enhancement of electron density in the SO(3) group can be tentatively attributed to primary radical formation predominantly involving the SO(3) group. In secondary reactions molecular species that are distinct from taurine are created in minute quantities, thereby introducing local departure from crystalline order, i.e. enhanced static disorder and a build-up of local strain. Our study provides evidence for ascribing the linear increase in ADPs as well as the expansion of the c axis to the accumulation of foreign species in the crystal, and not to a thermal effect. Once initiated, this process appears to continue also without radiation, however, then at a much reduced rate."
603,Effect of freezing and thawing on microbial activity and glyphosate degradation in two Norwegian soils.,16041712,Pest management science. Volume: 61 Issue: 9 Sep 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16041712/,"Little research has been done on pesticide dissipation in cold climates and there is a need to focus on the influence of climate on pesticide degradation in soil. Glyphosate, N-(phosphonomethyl)glycine, is a herbicide frequently used for controlling perennial weeds through application after harvest and was used as a model compound for this study. The effect of freeze-thaw activity on the availability of glyphosate in soil, and consequently its mineralization by soil microorganisms, was studied through laboratory incubations of repacked soil cores treated with 14C-labelled glyphosate and subjected to different freeze-thaw treatments. Winter simulation regimes applied were constant thaw (+5 degrees C), constant freezing (-5 degrees C), unstable conditions with short fluctuations (24 h of -5 degrees C followed by 24 h of +5 degrees C), and long duration fluctuations (3 weeks of -5 degrees C followed by 3 weeks of +5 degrees C). Distribution of 14C-glyphosate was followed during the incubation through measurements of the mineralized fraction (14CO2), soil water fraction, KOH extractable fraction, and non-extractable fraction. Microbial parameters used to characterize the soils were estimates of size of microbial biomass, overall microbial activity and microbial diversity. The constant freezing treatment exhibited the lowest amount of glyphosate mineralization. The constant thawed treatment and the treatments with fluctuating temperature exhibited significantly increased mineralization. These results were in accordance with the observed concentration of glyphosate in soil water; the higher the activity, the lower the concentration. The amount of glyphosate extractable with KOH and the resulting non-extractable fraction, however, were not significantly affected by soil type or temperature regime. The glyphosate mineralization pattern was comparable with the overall microbial activity in the soils. Observed different levels of diversity might explain some of the difference in total glyphosate mineralization between soils."

Volume: 7 Issue: 1 04 21 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28432348/,"Several studies have demonstrated that injection of double-stranded RNAs (dsRNA) homologous to mRNA for the white spot syndrome virus (WSSV) viral protein 28 (VP28) can induce protection in shrimp against WSSV through RNA interference (RNAi). In comparison to shrimp injected with either PBS or a green fluorescent protein (GFP) nonspecific dsRNA, we obtained nearly complete protection against WSSV infection in shrimp injected with VP28 dsRNA. Upregulation of host genes associated with small RNA silencing was measured 48 hours post treatment in groups injected with dsRNA, and although the VP28-treated group remained moderately upregulated after challenge with WSSV, many-fold higher induction was observed in both control groups reflecting the ongoing viral infection. RNA sequencing of VP28-treated shrimp demonstrated a siRNA population dominated by high levels of 22 nt long molecules narrowly targeting the VP28 mRNA both before and after challenge with WSSV. Conversely, while no siRNAs targeting WSSV were detected before challenge, a broad response of 22 nt siRNAs mapping across the entire WSSV genome were found in both control groups after challenge. These results give detailed insight to how dsRNA targeting VP28 function to induce protection against WSSV, by generating a highly focused population of 22 nt long siRNA molecules."

606,Biomarkers of exposure to heterocyclic amines: approaches to improve the exposure assessment.,12067575,Food and chemical toxicology : an international journal published for the British Industrial Biological Research Association. Volume: 40 Issue: 8 Aug 2002,2002,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12067575/,"Various methods of exposure assessment, such as questionnaires, sometimes combined with pictures of cooked meat, have been employed in investigations on the relationship between heterocyclic amines (HA) and health effects. However, as the content of heterocyclic amines vary greatly with cooking conditions, it is difficult to obtain an accurate estimate of the exposure. To improve the exposure assessment, the use of biomarkers has been investigated. The metabolism of 2-amino-3,8-dimethylimidazo[4,5-f]quinoxaline (MeIQx) and 2-amino-1-methyl-6-phenylimidazo[4,5-b]pyridine (PhIP) is well characterised. In humans, the major part of the dose is excreted in urine within 24-48 h following a meal. A few percent is excreted as parent compounds, whereas the major part is metabolites. Urinary level of parent HA reflects only recent exposure. However, the pattern of excreted metabolites might indicate the capacity to activate or detoxify HAs. The excretion of glucuronide conjugates of N-hydroxy-PhIP and N-hydroxy-MeIQx could be a marker for the N-hydroxylation capacity and the dose of the proximate metabolites. Recently, we proposed 5-OH-PhIP as a marker for the ultimate reactive metabolite of PhIP, since it is formed from this compound as a by-product along with the formation of PhIP-DNA adducts. In a search for biomarkers reflecting exposure over some time, blood protein adducts with a longer lifespan have been investigated, and PhIP adducts of serum albumin and haemoglobin from meat-consuming humans were recently reported. Many compounds, like drugs, nicotine and narcotics, bind to melanin in hair and give information on exposure for longer time periods. In mice, PhIP is irreversibly incorporated in a dose-dependent manner into hair, and in humans exposed to an ordinary diet, it was found to vary from <50 to 5000 pg PhIP/g hair. The incorporation is also dependent on the content of eumelanin. The use of PhIP in hair as a biomarker of exposure is promising, but needs validation, using other methods of exposure assessment."

The microorganisms were held in place by projections protruding from the epithelial cells, which were in close contact with the pili of the bacteria. In some areas, positive immunogold-labelled bacteria intermingled with bacteria lacking such labelling. None of the culture-negative controls harboured epithelial cells with positive immunogold-labelled bacteria.

Volume: 89 Issue: 4 Oct 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11055772/,"The objective of the study was to examine the effect of the homeopathic remedy Betula 30c vs. placebo for patients with birch pollen allergy. A double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled trial was carried out. Tablets were given for 4 weeks during the birch pollen season. The setting was Oslo, Norway, May 1995. Patients were aged between 18 and 50 y; 32 patients received Betula 30c tablets and 34 patients received placebo tablets. The main outcome measure was the total score of 17 different allergy symptoms. Daily total scores were calculated, as well as differences and ratios between the run-in and the following time periods. Point estimates of the median difference between the experimental and placebo groups, with their 95% confidence intervals, were the main measure of effect. No statistically significant difference between the groups was found during the first and last period of May. However, from 8 to 18 May, a clinically interesting difference was revealed between the groups, those receiving Betula 30c having fewer and less serious symptoms. For some days these differences were statistically significant. Surprisingly, this group reported more aggravation from the tablets than did the placebo group. With a statistical power of 70% for a defined clinically interesting difference (25%), the present results indicate that treatment with Betula 30c during the pollen season deserves further attention."

Autonomic function was not affected significantly in SLE patients as judged by standardised cardiovascular tests. Pancreatic polypeptide (PP) response to meal stimulation, which is impaired in parasympathetic failure, was for unknown reasons found to be significantly increased in SLE patients both in unstimulated and stimulated states. Neither cardiovascular nor serological tests could thus reveal significant autonomic dysfunction in SLE. Drugs with cardiovascular effects highly influenced autonomic function and could thus be misinterpreted as autonomic dysfunction caused by SLE itself."
615,Fracture risk and height: an association partly accounted for by cortical porosity of relatively thinner cortices.,23520013,Journal of bone and mineral research : the official journal of the American Society for Bone and Mineral Research. Volume: 28 Issue: 9 Sep 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23520013/,"Taller women are at increased risk for fracture despite having wider bones that better tolerate bending. Because wider bones require less material to achieve a given bending strength, we hypothesized that taller women assemble bones with relatively thinner and more porous cortices because excavation of a larger medullary canal may be accompanied by excavation of more intracortical canals. Three-dimensional images of distal tibia, fibula, and radius were obtained in vivo using high-resolution peripheral quantitative computed tomography (HRpQCT) in a twin study of 345 females aged 40 to 61 years, 93 with at least one fracture. Cortical porosity <100 µm as well as >100 µm, and microarchitecture, were quantified using Strax1.0, a new algorithm. Multivariable linear and logistic regression using generalized estimating equation (GEE) methods quantified associations between height and microarchitecture and estimated the associations with fracture risk. Each standard deviation (SD) greater height was associated with a 0.69 SD larger tibia total cross-sectional area (CSA), 0.66 SD larger medullary CSA, 0.50 SD higher medullary CSA/total CSA (i.e., thinner cortices relative to the total CSA due to a proportionally larger medullary area), and 0.42 SD higher porosity (all p < 0.001). Cortical area was 0.45 SD larger in absolute terms but 0.50 SD smaller in relative terms. These observations were confirmed by examining trait correlations in twin pairs. Fracture risk was associated with height, total CSA, medullary CSA/total CSA, and porosity in univariate analyses. In multivariable analyses, distal tibia, medullary CSA/total CSA, and porosity predicted fracture independently; height was no longer significant. Each 1 SD greater porosity was associated with fracture; odds ratios (ORs) and 95% confidence intervals (CIs) are as follows: distal tibia, OR = 1.55 (95% CI, 1.11-2.15); distal fibula, OR = 1.47 (95% CI, 1.14-1.88); and distal radius, OR = 1.22 (95% CI, 0.96-1.55). Taller women assemble wider bones with relatively thinner and more porous cortices predisposing to fracture. "

Twenty-eight unique polypeptide sequences were identified from protein samples enriched in OMs. Only six of these polypeptides had previously been identified. The predictions from novel bioinformatic methods predicting beta-barrel outer membrane proteins (OMPs) and OM lipoproteins were compared to proteins identified experimentally. BOMP ( http://www.bioinfo.no/tools/bomp ) predicted 43 beta-barrel OMPs (1.45%) from the 2,959 annotated open reading frames. This was a lower percentage than predicted from other Gram-negative proteomes (1.8-3%). More than half of the predicted BOMPs in M. capsulatus were annotated as (conserved) hypothetical proteins with significant similarity to very few sequences in Swiss-Prot or TrEMBL. The experimental data and the computer predictions indicated that the protein composition of the M. capsulatus OM subproteome was different from that of other Gram-negative bacteria studied in a similar manner. A new program, Lipo, was developed that can analyse entire predicted proteomes and give a list of recognised lipoproteins categorised according to their lipo-box similarity to known Gram-negative lipoproteins ( http://www.bioinfo.no/tools/lipo ). This report is the first using a proteomics and bioinformatics approach to identify the OM subproteome of an obligate methanotroph."

The subjects were tested for recognition of abstract spatial designs and words after a 5 s retention interval. The PD patients failed to respond in 29% of all trials, but the overall accuracy was similar to that in the control group when these trials were excluded. The corresponding ERP results show serial position variations both after presentation of the probe items, and after presentation of the memory set items. The amplitudes were generally lower at all positions for the PD patients at the parietal midline electrode, and the amplitudes were similar for both groups at the frontal electrode. Also, the ERP latencies were significantly slower for the PD patients than for the control group at all conditions. Indirectly the data are consistent with an interpretation of cognitive deficit in PD stressing attention resources. "

Two hundred subjects were recruited from both sites in January. At the follow-up in August, 180 and 150 subjects in Ghana and Norway participated, respectively. Use of a weekly sleep diary indicated low to moderately strong seasonal changes in rise- and bedtime, sleep efficiency and sleep onset latency only in the northern latitude. No seasonal changes in sleep duration or night awakenings were observed. The self-report measures indicated moderate to strong seasonal differences in insomnia and fatigue, and weaker differences in depressed mood in Norway, but small to non-existing seasonal differences in Ghana. Lack of daylight was related to phase-delayed rise- and bedtimes, increased problems falling asleep, daytime fatigue and depressive mood. However, total sleep duration and sleep quality appeared unaffected."

Volume: 26 Issue: 1,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2054296/,"Two experiments are reviewed that demonstrate effects of brain laterality on human classical conditioning. Pictures of facial emotional expressions were used as conditioned stimuli (CSs) together with shock as unconditioned stimulus (UCS). Bilateral electrodermal responses were recorded as dependent measures. In the first experiment, one group was conditioned to an angry face, and one group to a happy face. During extinction, the face-CSs were presented to the right hemisphere on half of the trials and to the left hemisphere on the other half of the trials. Results showed that the right hemisphere was superior in showing persisting effects of learning, and especially to the angry CS+. In the second experiment, lateralized presentations of the angry and happy faces were made during acquisition, with foveal presentations during extinction. Once again, the angry face elicited greater skin conductance responses (SCRs) during extinction in the group that had this stimulus presented to the right hemisphere during acquisition. It is concluded that emotional conditioning is differentially regulated by the two hemispheres of the brain."

Here, we investigated the association between male MHC genotype and mating success in the brown bear. We analysed fragments of sequences coding for the peptide-binding region of the highly polymorphic MHC class I and class II DRB genes, while controlling for genome-wide effects using a panel of 18 microsatellite markers. Male mating success did not depend on the number of alleles shared with the female or amino-acid distance between potential mates at either locus. Furthermore, we found no indication of female mating preferences for MHC similarity being contingent on the number of alleles the females carried. Finally, we found no significant association between the number of MHC alleles a male carried and his mating success. Thus, our results provided no support for the role of mate choice in shaping MHC polymorphism in the brown bear. "

A more extensive inhibition at direct than at indirect stimulation, a simultaneous effect on the electromyogram, and an attenuation of the inhibitory effect in preparations made hyperexcitable with Ca(2+)-free solution, myotonia or veratridine, indicated an interference with the gating mechanism of the sarcolemma. The excitation-contraction uncoupling with BDM was additive to the similar effect of dantrolene. A synergistic effect was not found, and neither agent alone nor both in combination caused a complete excitation-contraction uncoupling. Several differences between the effects of BDM and dantrolene were disclosed: Lowering the temperature increased and decreased the effect of BDM and dantrolene, respectively. Tetanic stimulation and high Ca2+ or high K+ antagonized the effect of dantrolene and did not affect the BDM-induced inhibition. Ca(2+)-free solution potentiated the effect of dantrolene and antagonized the effect of BDM. Caffeine and KCl contractures were inhibited by BDM, whereas the propranolol contracture due to Na,K-ATPase inhibition, which is completely inhibited by dantrolene, was unaffected by BDM."

Volume: 137 Issue: 2 Oct 1989,1989,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2515750/,"To examine to what extent the reabsorbate concentrations, calculated as the flux ratios between solutes and water, represent the fluid composition in the lateral intercellular space (LIS) in the proximal tubules, reabsorption was stimulated by elevating PCO2 from 5 to 13 kPa before and during infusion of mannitol to a plasma concentration of 70 mM in volume-expanded dogs receiving ethacrynic acid. The reabsorbate concentration of NaHCO3 increased by 50 mM during mannitol infusion. The real concentration of NaHCO3 in LIS could not, however, be elevated by this amount, since the driving forces for fluid reabsorption then would have increased during osmotic diuresis due to diffusion of mannitol into LIS from plasma. A model analysis of diffusion in LIS showed that transcellular transport can only lead to trivial increases of LIS concentrations compared to plasma, whereas diffusion across tight junctions can increase LIS concentrations by several mM. NaCl diffusion and coupled transcellular water transport may therefore represent a significant contribution to total bicarbonate-dependent NaCl and water reabsorption in the proximal tubules."

Volume: 115 Issue: 16 Apr 28 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21306143/,"The regulation of protein kinases requires flexibility, especially near the ATP binding site. The cancer drug target Aurora A is inhibited by the ATP site inhibitor VX680, and published crystal structures show two distinct conformations. In one, a refolded glycine-rich loop creates a stacked π-π interaction between the conserved aromatic residue of the glycine-rich loop hairpin turn (F144) and the inhibitor. This refolding, associated with binding to a peptide derived from the cofactor TPX2, is absent in the other structure. We use surface plasmon resonance to measure VX680 binding to native and mutant F144A Aurora A kinase domains, with and without the TPX2 peptide. Results show that the F144 aromatic side chain contributes 2 kcal/mol to the VX680 binding energy, independent of the TPX2 peptide. This indicates that distinct VX680 bound conformations of Aurora A cannot be simply correlated with TPX2 binding and that Aurora A retains flexibility when inhibitor-bound.

Therefore, we were interested in the relation with extended follow-up, also focusing on single subtypes and a variety of intake of fruit and vegetables. Fruit and vegetable consumption was assessed at baseline. After an average of 13 years of follow-up, 3,370 participants were diagnosed with colon or rectal cancer. Diet diversity scores were constructed to quantify variety in fruit and vegetable consumption. A lower risk of colon cancer was observed with higher self-reported consumption of fruit and vegetable combined (HR Q4 vs. Q1 0.87, 95% CI 0.75-1.01, p for trend 0.02), but no consistent association was observed for separate consumption of fruits and vegetables. No associations with risk of rectal cancer were observed. The few observed associations for some fruit and vegetable subtypes with colon cancer risk may have been due to chance. Variety in consumption of fruits and vegetables was not associated with a lower risk of colon or rectal cancer. Although a lower risk of colon cancer is suggested with high consumption of fruit and vegetables, this study does not support a clear inverse association between fruit and vegetable consumption and colon or rectal cancer beyond a follow-up of more than 10 years. Attenuation of the risk estimates from dietary changes over time cannot be excluded, but appears unlikely. "

There is rich genetic polymorphism in apoB, first detected as the Ag allotypes of LDL, but today mostly examined at the DNA level. Genes contribute to the population variation in LDL and apoB levels and alleles in polymorphisms at the apoB locus are candidate genes with respect to control of lipid levels and susceptibility to atherosclerosis and MI. The XbaI polymorphism at the apoB locus, which involves the third base of threonin codon 2488 (ACC-->ACT) without changing the amino acid sequence was examined in a case-control study comprising 238 survivors of myocardial infarction (MI) and 621 controls. In univariate analysis, frequencies of genotypes in this polymorphism were not statistically different between patients and controls of either sex. However, in multivariate logistic regression analysis, the odds ratio X-X- homozygotes (homozygotes for absence of restriction site) for having MI compared to the pooled group of heterozygotes and X+X+homozygotes (homozygotes for presence of restriction site) was 2.16 (p = 0.007), after adjustments for age, sex, and levels of apoB, high density lipoprotein (HDL) cholesterol (HDLC) and Lp(a) lipoprotein. It appeared that heterozygotes do not have increased risk, compared to the X+X+ homozygotes. Stratification according to low or high levels of apoB, HDLC and Lp(a) lipoprotein, showed that the X-X- genotype was more common in patients than controls, in all subgroups.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Volume: 112 11 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29037414/,"There is broad consensus among paleoanthropologists that meat-eating played a key role in the evolution of Homo, but the details of where, when, and why are hotly debated. It has been argued that increased faunivory was causally connected with hominin adaptation to open, savanna habitats. If savanna-dwelling chimpanzees eat meat more frequently than do forest chimpanzees, it would support the notion that open, dry, seasonal habitats promote hunting or scavenging by hominoids. Here we present observational and fecal analysis data on vertebrate consumption from several localities within the dry, open Ugalla region of Tanzania. Combining these with published fecal analyses, we summarize chimpanzee vertebrate consumption rates, showing quantitatively that savanna chimpanzee populations do not differ significantly from forest populations. Compared with forest populations, savanna chimpanzees consume smaller vertebrates that are less likely to be shared, and they do so more seasonally. Analyses of chimpanzee hunting that focus exclusively on capture of forest monkeys are thus difficult to apply to chimpanzee faunivory in open-country habitats and may be misleading when used to model early hominin behavior. These findings bear on discussions of why chimpanzees hunt and suggest that increases in hominin faunivory were related to differences between hominins and chimpanzees and/or differences between modern and Pliocene savanna woodland environments."

In addition, to analyze whether expression of these receptors is site-related (pleural versus peritoneal MM, solid lesions versus effusions). Sections from 81 MM (57 biopsies, 24 effusions) were analyzed. Sixty-one mesotheliomas were of pleural origin, while the remaining 20 were peritoneal. Effusion specimens consisted of 6 peritoneal and 18 pleural effusions, while biopsies consisted of 14 peritoneal and 43 pleural lesions. Specimens were immunohistochemically stained using antibodies against p75 and phospho-TrkA (p-TrkA). Six effusions were additionally analyzed for p-TrkA expression using immunoblotting (IB). p-TrkA membrane expression (66/81 specimens; 81%) was by far more frequent than that of p75 (26/81 specimens; 32%). In addition, p-TrkA expression was significantly higher in peritoneal MM compared to their pleural counterparts (20/20 versus 46/61 positive tumors; P = 0.014). p-TrkA membrane expression was marginally higher in effusions (P = 0.058), while the opposite was true for p75 membrane expression (P = 0.008) and p-TrkA cytoplasmic expression (P = 0.003). In conclusion, our results document for the first time frequent expression of p-TrkA and lower expression of p75 in MM, in agreement with the biological aggressiveness of this tumor. The enhanced expression of p-TrkA in peritoneal MM, tumors that appear in younger patients, and in effusions as compared to solid tumors, suggest that p-TrkA plays a significant role in the biology of this disease and may aid in defining tumor progression in this setting."

A new immunometric semi-quantitative assay, NycoCard CRP, has recently been developed. CRP was analysed at the local health centres by the new assay in 288 consultations where patients came because of infections. Parallel CRP values were obtained by an established reference method. The two procedures had an acceptable correlation (r = 0.85). The primary care doctors also registered the clinical information they obtained from each CRP result. CRP was helpful in indicating the presence, or absence of bacterial infection in more than half the consultations due to new infections. CRP was thought to yield more clinical information than the erythrocyte sedimentation rate in almost every case."

By eliciting hypoglycemic effects via actions on the autonomic nervous system and protection of pancreatic beta-cells, CAR is also relevant in diabetes. We investigated the expression of genes involved in CAR biosynthesis, degradation, and membrane transport pathways, in the pancreas and brains of mice treated with streptozotocin (STZ) and then exposed to dietary CAR. We induced hyperglycemia by STZ intraperitoneal injections; then, STZ-treated mice received drinking water with or without CAR for two weeks. We report that CAR administration elicits beneficial effects on blood glucose levels and weight loss in STZ-treated mice and, remarkably, on the insulin gene products in the pancreas, preserving gene expression from STZ challenge. Also, we describe mRNA downregulation of the Slc15a2/Pept2 (dipeptide transporter) and Cndp2 (intracellular dipeptidase) genes in the pancreas of hyperglycemic mice, and dysregulation of Carns1 (CAR synthase), Pept2 and Cndp2 in brains; interestingly, dietary CAR elicits counteracting effects. These expression patterns associate with variations of CAR content in tissues of mice. Overall, our report suggests a direct role of CAR in the diabetes-affected pancreas and in the diabetes-targeted CNS, proposing (dys)regulation of CAR&rsquo;s homeostasis as a marker condition."

Volume: 16 Issue: 3 May 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7565106/,"Expression of type IV pili appears to be a requisite determinant of infectivity for the strict human pathogens Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Neisseria meningitidis. The assembly of these colonization factors is a complex process. This report describes a new pilus-assembly gene, pilG, that immediately precedes the gonococcal (Gc) pilD gene encoding the pre-pilin leader peptidase. The nucleotide sequence of this region revealed a single complete open reading frame whose derived polypeptide displayed significant identities to the pilus-assembly protein PilC of Pseudomonas aeruginosa and other polytopic integral cytoplasmic membrane constituents involved in protein export and competence. A unique polypeptide of M(r) 38 kDa corresponding to the gene product was identified. A highly related gene and flanking sequences were cloned from a group B polysaccharide-producing strain of N. meningitidis (Mc). The results indicate that the pilG genes and genetic organization at these loci in Gc and Mc are extremely conserved. Hybridization studies strongly suggest that pilG-related genes exist in commensal Neisseria species and other species known to express type IV pili. Defined genetic lesions were created by using insertional and transposon mutagenesis and moved into the Gc and Mc chromosomes by allelic replacement. Chromosomal pilG insertion mutants were devoid of pili and displayed dramatically reduced competence for transformation. These findings could not be ascribed to pilin-gene alterations or to polarity exerted on pilD expression. The results indicated that PilG exerts its own independent role in neisserial pilus biogenesis."

The prevalence for all coastal fish (n = 4427) pooled was 15%, and there were great differences between fish species and seasons. Lumpfish Cyclopterus lumpus L. spawners were the most infected fish, with a prevalence of 61% and a median intensity of 4 lice fish(-1), whereas gadids had a mean prevalence of 19% and a median infection of 1 to 2 lice fish(-1). Sea trout Salmo trutta L. and herring Clupea harengus L. carried C. elongatus at prevalence values of 29 and 21%, respectively. The results were compared with infection data for immature North Sea lumpfish. Lumpfish spawners caught on the coast in March to April had fewer lice than North Sea lumpfish in July. Spawners carried mostly adult lice, as did coastal fish hosts in May to June. The low development rates of lice at low spring temperatures and new genetic data suggest that the May to June adult lice could not have been offspring of the March to April lice, indicating transfer of adult lice to coastal fish. Most coastal fish species appeared to acquire new C. elongatus infections between May to June and September. The relatively high numbers of chalimii on North Sea lumpfish suggest that offshore fish sustain an oceanic population of this louse species."

Jan 24 2019,2019,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30677186/,"In this opinion article, we provide compelling arguments of why early screening for pregnancies following previous cesarean delivery would be beneficial. First, we provide an overview of the perils of undiagnosed or misdiagnosed cesarean scar pregnancies (CSP), mostly with bleeding, but also with other complications, that may lead to multiple surgeries, uterine artery embolization, loss of fertility and in rare cases of documented deaths. There is well-documented histopathological connection between CSP and the placental adherence spectrum (PAS) suggesting that CSP is a precursor to PAS. We argue that the ultrasound markers to recognize CSP are present in the 1st trimester and that they may go on and become 2nd and 3rd trimester cases of PAS. We stress that early 5-7 weeks ultrasound screening for CSP is strongly indicated (if not mandated) and can be easily implemented alongside several other proven 1st trimester screening tests.

Volume: 106 Issue: 1 Nov 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18700232/,"Increased levels of particulate matter have been associated with adverse effects in the respiratory as well as the cardiovascular system. The biological mechanisms behind these associations are still unresolved. Among potential mechanisms, particulate matter-associated cardiac effects may be initiated by inhaled small-sized particles, particle components and/or mediators related to inflammation that translocate into the pulmonary circulation. In the present study cytokine responses (interleukin [IL]-6, IL-1beta, and tumor necrosis factor [TNF]-alpha) of primary rat cardiomyocytes and cardiofibroblasts in mono- and cocultures induced by direct exposure to particles, were compared with cytokine responses induced by mediators released by particle-exposed primary rat epithelial lung cells (conditioned media). Cells were exposed to a model ultrafine particle (ultrafine carbon black, Printex 90) and in selected experiments to an urban air particle sample (SRM 1648, St Louis, MO). In lung cell cultures both particle types induced release of IL-6 and IL-1beta, whereas TNF-alpha was only detected upon exposure to St Louis particles. The release of IL-6 by cardiac cells was strongly enhanced upon exposure to conditioned media, and markedly exceeded the response to direct particle exposure. IL-1, but not TNF-alpha, seemed necessary, but not sufficient, for this enhanced IL-6 release. The role of IL-1 was demonstrated by use of an IL-1 receptor antagonist that partially reduced the effect of the conditioned media, and by a stimulating effect on the cardiac cell release of IL-6 by exogenous addition of IL-1alpha and IL-1beta. These in vitro findings lend support to the hypothesis that particle-induced cardiac inflammation and disease may involve lung-derived mediators."

Volume: 273 Issue: 21 Nov 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17010167/,"We describe the cloning, overexpression, purification, characterization and crystal structure of chitinase G, a single-domain family 19 chitinase from the Gram-positive bacterium Streptomyces coelicolor A3(2). Although chitinase G was not capable of releasing 4-methylumbelliferyl from artificial chitooligosaccharide substrates, it was capable of degrading longer chitooligosaccharides at rates similar to those observed for other chitinases. The enzyme was also capable of degrading a colored colloidal chitin substrate (carboxymethyl-chitin-remazol-brilliant violet) and a small, presumably amorphous, subfraction of alpha-chitin and beta-chitin, but was not capable of degrading crystalline chitin completely. The crystal structures of chitinase G and a related Streptomyces chitinase, chitinase C [Kezuka Y, Ohishi M, Itoh Y, Watanabe J, Mitsutomi M, Watanabe T & Nonaka T (2006) J Mol Biol358, 472-484], showed that these bacterial family 19 chitinases lack several loops that extend the substrate-binding grooves in family 19 chitinases from plants. In accordance with these structural features, detailed analysis of the degradation of chitooligosaccharides by chitinase G showed that the enzyme has only four subsites (- 2 to + 2), as opposed to six (- 3 to + 3) for plant enzymes. The most prominent structural difference leading to reduced size of the substrate-binding groove is the deletion of a 13-residue loop between the two putatively catalytic glutamates. The importance of these two residues for catalysis was confirmed by a site-directed mutagenesis study."

It also had no significant effects on the following haematological parameters: erythrocyte count; leucocyte counts (WBC); haematocrit; Hb; mean corpuscular volume; mean corpuscular Hb content; mean corpuscular Hb concentration. However, WBC and respiratory burst activity were significantly affected by dietary FOS supplementation. Evaluation of the cultivable autochthonous intestinal microbiota revealed a significant increase in the levels of total viable heterotrophic aerobic bacteria and lactic acid bacteria in fish fed diets supplemented with 2 and 3% FOS. Furthermore, dietary FOS supplementation significantly increased the survival rate and stress resistance of carp fry compared with the control treatment. These results encourage conducting further research on the administration of FOS and other prebiotics in carp fry studies."

Volume: 47 Issue: 1 Jan 1998,1998,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9467659/,"Intensive chemotherapy for acute leukaemia is followed by a period of severe chemotherapy-induced leukopenia. We used a limiting dilution assay to investigate whether remaining CD4+ and CD8+ T lymphocytes derived from such leukopenic patients could be activated and undergo clonogenic proliferation. The activation signal in our model was accessory cells (irradiated normal peripheral blood mononuclear cells) + phytohaemagglutinin (PHA) + interleukin-2 (IL-2). During severe leukopenia a majority of circulating lymphocytes were CD4+ T cells. Clonogenic proliferating T lymphocytes were detected for all patients. Higher frequencies of clonogenic cells were detected in the CD8+ subset as compared to the CD4+ subset. However, for both subsets frequencies of proliferating cells were decreased compared with healthy individuals. The CD4+ and CD8+ lymphocytes were also capable of proliferation in response to alloactivation, and accessory cells mainly containing acute myelogenous leukaemia blast were efficient as accessory cells for activation. For the CD4+ cells, increased proliferation was detected in the presence of acute myelogenous leukaemia (AML) blasts compared with normal accessory cells. Based on our results we conclude that: (1) although acute leukaemia patients with therapy-induced leukopenia have both a quantitative and a qualitative T-cell defect, (2) the remaining T-cell population includes a subset capable of clonogenic proliferation. However, (3) proliferation of the clonogenic CD4+ cells can be modulated by AML blasts."

Volume: 25 Issue: 1-2 2006",2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16566715/,"Photodynamic therapy (PDT) typically involves systemic or topical administration of a tumor-localizing photosensitizer or prodrug and its subsequent activation by visible light. This results primarily in singlet oxygen-induced photodamage to the tumor. 5-Aminolevulinic acid (ALA) and its derivatives have recently been widely used for PDT due to their selective induction in tumor of endogenous protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a potent photosensitizer. Although ALA-PDT has achieved successful results in the treatment of several clinical oncological and nononcological diseases, the mechanisms of this modality are still not fully elucidated. In the present study, the human colon carcinoma cell line 320DM was treated in vitro with PDT using hexaminolevulinate (HAL), a hexylester of ALA known to be 50 to 100 times more efficient at producing PpIX formation than ALA itself. PpIX production increased with increasing HAL concentrations in the cells and phototoxicity of the cells was enhanced with increasing light (450 nm) doses. HAL-PDT induced apoptotic cell death, as measured by nuclear staining of Hoechst 33342 for fluorescence microscopy, DNA electrophoresis and TdT staining for flow cytometry. PDT with 5 muM of HAL and a light dose of 640 mJ/cm2 produced a 75% apoptotic cell population 40 hr after the treatment. Furthermore, the loss of mitochondrial membrane potential coincident with the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytosol led to a rapid activation of caspase-9 and caspase-3 (an executioner), indicating that the selective damage to the mitochondria by HAL-PDT can induce a cytochrome-c-mediated apoptotic response in the 320DM cells."
669,Moose selecting for specific nutritional composition of birch places limits on food acceptability.,29375784,Ecology and evolution. Volume: 8 Issue: 2 01 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29375784/,"Despite decades of intense research, it remains largely unsolved which nutritional factors underpin food selection by large herbivores in the wild. We measured nutritional composition of birch foliage (Betula pubescens) available to, and used by, moose (Alces alces) in natural settings in two neighboring regions with contrasting animal body mass. This readily available food source is a staple food item in the diet of moose in the high-fitness region, but apparently underutilized by moose in the low-fitness region. Available birch foliage in the two regions had similar concentrations of macronutrients (crude protein [CP], fiber fractions, and water-soluble carbohydrates [WSC]), although a notably lower variation of WSC in the low-fitness region. For minerals, there were several area differences: available birch foliage in the low-fitness region had less Mg (depending on year) and P, but more Ca, Zn, Cu, and Mn. It also had higher concentrations of some plant secondary metabolites: chlorogenic acids, quercetins, and especially MeOH-soluble condensed tannins. Despite the area differences in available foliage, we found the same nutritional composition of birch foliage used in the two regions. Compared to available birch foliage, moose consistently used birch foliage with more CP, more structural fiber (mainly hemicellulose), less WSC, higher concentrations of several minerals (Ca, Zn, K, Mn, Cu), and lower concentrations of some secondary metabolites (most importantly, MeOH-soluble condensed tannins). Our study conceptually supports the nutrient-balancing hypothesis for a large herbivore: within a given temporal frame, moose select for plant material that matches a specific nutritional composition. As our data illustrate, different moose populations may select for the same composition even when the nutritional composition available in a given food source varies between their living areas. Such fastidiousness limits the proportion of available food that is acceptable to the animal and has bearings on our understanding and application of the concept of carrying capacity."
670,Beyond the hype and hope: Critical considerations for intranasal oxytocin research in autism spectrum disorder.,27651096,Autism research : official journal of the International Society for Autism Research. Volume: 10 Issue: 1 Jan 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27651096/,"Extensive research efforts in the last decade have been expended into understanding whether intranasal oxytocin may be an effective therapeutic in treating social communication impairments in individuals with autism spectrum disorder (ASD). After much hyped early findings, subsequent clinical trials of longer-term administration have yielded more conservative and mixed evidence. However, it is still unclear at this stage whether these more disappointing findings reflect a true null effect or are mitigated by methodological differences masking true effects. In this review, we comprehensively evaluate the rationale for oxytocin as a therapeutic, evaluating evidence from randomized controlled trials, case reports, and open-label studies of oxytocin administration in individuals with ASD. The evidence to date, including reviews of preregistered trials, suggests a number of critical considerations for the design and interpretation of research in this area. These include considering the choice of ASD outcome measures, dosing and nasal spray device issues, and participant selection. Despite these limitations in the field to date, there remains significant potential for oxytocin to ameliorate aspects of the persistent and debilitating social impairments in individuals with ASD. Given the considerable media hype around new treatments for ASD, as well as the needs of eager families, there is an urgent need for researchers to prioritise considering such factors when conducting well-designed and controlled studies to further advance this field.

673,Universal Design as a Booster for Housing Quality and Architectural Practice.,27534294,Studies in health technology and informatics. Volume: 229 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27534294/,"Norwegian central government has for the last decade increasingly focused on universal design. Fundamental changes in the Norwegian building code and corresponding regulations in 2010 give an apparently clear framework for the implementation of accessibility and universal design. However, it seems that neither increased awareness of accessibility requirements and universal design, nor compliance with the building code guarantees improvement of housing quality and usability. The Norwegian regulations have gone further in the direction of performance requirements than most other countries. This applies to all types of requirements, including requirements for usability, functionality and accessibility. Hardly any specifications are to be found in the regulations. Ideally, this lack of specifications should give designers the opportunity to develop innovative answers and hence to respond to different contexts and needs. Still, many architects and builders ask for clear specifications, in order to simplify and speed up design processes and make control of solutions easier. Many architects understand guidelines as minimum requirements, and are thus reproducing the identical solutions without considering the context and the needs of the users. They see accessibility as another regulatory pressure and requirements as restrictions rather than positive incentives. However, there are examples of designers who have internalised the regulatory framework and thus are able to create and integrate inclusive design in their daily work. Based on recent research conducted by SINTEF Building and Infrastructure and financed by the Norwegian State Housing Bank, this paper presents examples of practice where dwellings have been developed within a framework of universal design. Focus of the research has been on the approach of the design team and their understanding and use of the regulatory framework in order to create better homes in dialogue with the building authorities. Main objectives are to: - Contribute to better understanding of universal design as a tool and a method to improve housing quality and usability - Investigate the conditions for developing dwellings with innovative and functional solutions in compliance with the building code - Discuss challenges in interpreting the requirements and in taking the needs of various resident groups into account.

The refinements are based on centre-disc intensities only. An algorithm for param-eter-sensitive pixel sampling of experimental intensities is implemented in the refinement procedure to increase sensitivity and computer speed. Typical three-beam effects are illustrated for the centrosymmetric case. The modified refinement method is applied to determine amplitudes and three-phase structure invariants in noncentrosymmetric InP. The accuracy of the results is shown to depend on the choice of the initial parameters in the refinement. Even unrealistic starting assumptions and incorrect temperature factor lead to stable results for the structure invariant. The examples show that the accuracy varies from 1 to 10 degrees in the electron three-phase invariants determined and from 0.5 to 5% for the amplitudes. Individual phases could not be determined in the present case owing to spatial intensity correlations between phase-sensitive pixels. However, for the three-phase structure invariant, stable solutions were found."

The HindIII restriction profiles clearly distinguished geographically distinct CPXV isolates, whereas only minor differences were found between the profiles of geographically linked isolates. The complete gene sequences encoding the cytokine response modifier B, the hemagglutinin and the Chinese hamster ovary host range protein were determined for the same isolates and included in phylogenetic analysis. By including representative OPV sequences from GenBank, detailed comparative analyses were performed showing pronounced heterogeneity among CPXVs compared to members of other OPV species. However, a close relationship between the Norwegian (3 of 4 isolates) and Swedish isolates was detected, whereas the isolate from Finland was more closely related to a Russian isolate for all three genes compared. We infer that the investigated CPXVs have distinct evolutionary histories in different rodent lineages."

The parallel effect of these kinase inhibitors suggests that TPA induces the effects through activation of protein kinase C (PKC). This is consistent with the view that PKC is involved in both the induction of transformed morphology and the inhibition of GJIC. All the inhibitors studied reduced PKC activity in SHE cell extracts. IC(50) values were determined to be 0.008 mum for staurosporine, 55 mum for H-7 and 16 mum for polymyxin B. The values for staurosporine and H-7 corresponded to those concentrations that suppressed TPA-induced cellular responses. The lack of effect of polymyxin B on whole SHE cells indicates that this compound does not enter the cells."

Long-term potentiation (LTP) in the hippocampus is often studied as a model of learning and memory. It has recently been shown that long-term excitation may be induced in single wide dynamic range (WDR) neurones in the spinal dorsal horn of rats after tetanic stimulation to the sciatic nerve. The present study shows that similar long-term changes can also be induced by a severe natural stimulus. Single unit extracellular recordings were made in urethane anaesthetized rats and the firing responses of WDR neurones evoked by a single electrical stimulus to the peripheral nerve were recorded every 4 min. After repeated crushing of tissue (including bone) corresponding to the receptive field of the WDR neurones (the conditioning stimulus) followed by a proximal total peripheral nerve block, the C-fibre evoked responses were increased (P < 0.001) for a 3 h observation period compared with baseline responses and control animals. In control animals the nerve block was applied before the conditioning stimulus. We suggest that a long-term increase of the excitability of WDR neurones may be important for the development of long lasting and chronic pain disorders after an acute but severe noxious stimulus."

We report an approach to raise the yield of recombinant proteins from encapsulated cells substantially. We hypothesized that by optimizing the encapsulation procedure, the production efficacy from the encapsulated cells could be increased. HEK 293 EBNA cells were genetically engineered to produce angiostatin. Encapsulation was performed by varying bead size, cellular density, homogeneity, and ion composition of the gel. The morphology and viability of the cells and the release of angiostatin were studied. Computer software was developed for three-dimensional imaging and quantification of cell viability. Angiostatin production was assessed at 3, 6, and 11 weeks using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Inhomogeneous gels facilitated cell growth and viability. The most efficient inhomogeneous microcapsules were generated by reducing the size and cellular density of the beads. The viability and the production of angiostatin were 3 to 5 times higher than in the homogeneous capsules. Significant amounts of viable cells were present in both homogeneous and inhomogeneous beads after 6 months of culture. The stability of the alginate matrix was greatly enhanced by gelling in the presence of barium. In conclusion, the viability and production efficacy of recombinant angiostatin from alginate-encapsulated cells can be increased considerably by optimizing the encapsulation procedure. The development of such optimized microcapsules brings cell-encapsulation therapy further towards clinical use in cancer therapy."

Volume: 9 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30487782/,"Aquaculture has the potential to become a major food supplier in a world with an increasing human population, and increased consumption of fish will likely have positive health implications. For marine aquaculture, the production of high quality juveniles is a bottleneck. Survival until the juvenile stage is typically as low as 10-15% for many species, which indicates suboptimal rearing conditions. Substantial evidence indicates that the poor performance and viability of larvae is largely due to detrimental larvae-microbiota interactions. This emphasises the need for microbial management strategies in the cultivation of marine fish larvae. Disinfection and probiotics are the most studied microbial management methods so far. However, most studies on these methods overlooked the role of mutualistic relationships between microbes and hosts, and have not proposed or examined methods steering toward such relationships. Based on ecological theory and a number of experiments, we find support for the hypothesis that current practise in aquaculture generally selects for r-strategic, opportunistic microbes, which results in detrimental host-microbiota interactions. Thus, the challenge is to develop technology and methods for microbial management at the ecosystem level that creates a K-selected microbial community, and by this mean select against r-strategic opportunists. Here we summarise experiments done during 25 years and with marine larvae of five different species showing that: (1) K-selection strategies result in different water microbiota with less opportunists, (2) this influences the microbiota of the fish larvae, and (3) the larvae cultivated in water inhabited by a K-selected microbiota perform better. Improved performance of larvae includes improved appetite, earlier onset of and faster growth, increased survival, and increased robustness to stress. K-selection as a method for management of the microbial community is a robust approach that allows steering of host-microbiota interactions in larviculture toward mutualism. It could also be applicable for young stages of other domesticated animals. Our review illustrates that a change from a ""beat-them"" to a ""join-them"" strategy for microbial management in larval rearing can lead to a more sustainable aquaculture industry."

Volume: 13 Issue: 4 Apr 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16414309/,"Naked DNA vaccines have a number of advantages over conventional vaccines, but induce only weak immune responses. We have here investigated if this inadequacy may be overcome by inducing muscle to secrete fusion proteins with the ability to target antigen-presenting cells (APC). The novel targeted vaccines are homodimers with (i) two identical single-chain fragment variable (scFv) targeting units specific for MHC class II molecules on mouse APC, (ii) a human Ig hinge and C(H)3 dimerization unit, and (iii) two identical scFv tumor antigenic units (idiotypes) from B cell cancers. After plasmid injection and electroporation of mouse muscle, secreted vaccine proteins (vaccibodies) delivered idiotypic tumor antigen to APC in draining lymph nodes for induction of T and B cell responses that protected mice against tumor challenges with a multiple myeloma (MOPC315) and a B cell lymphoma (A20). Targeting to APC was essential for these effects. The results show that immunogenicity of plasmid DNA vaccines can be increased by inducing muscle to secrete proteins that target antigen to APC."

A polymerase chain reaction approach was therefore applied for sequencing the fomA gene of F. periodonticum, and nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequences were aligned and compared with the corresponding sequences of different strains of F. nucleatum. In all strains we found a common protein upstream of the fomA gene. The noncoding area upstream of the putative -35 region of the F. periodonticum fomA gene exhibited little sequence similarity with the F. nucleatum gene. The transcriptional unit of FomA, on the other hand, was very similar, with the similarities concentrated in domains that were interspersed with hypervariable regions. A topology model was made and compared with those made for F. nucleatum. This indicated that the great similarities reside in the membrane-spanning segments of the protein, while most cell surface exposed loops were hypervariable. The results strongly support the proposed model for FomA and also indicate that these taxa are related but on a lower level than the subspecies level. The codon usage of F. periodonticum is comparable to that of F. nucleatum, and the triplet AGA is the only codon used for arginine."

Volume: 42 Issue: 2 Feb 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7744618/,"CD is precipitated in susceptible individuals by ingestion of wheat gluten. The disease is strongly associated to the HLA-DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) (DQ2) heterodimer, where both the DQ alpha and DQ beta chains are required for susceptibility. We have recently shown that gluten-specific CD4+ T cells from the small intestinal mucosa of CD patients are predominantly restricted by the CD-associated HLA-DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) heterodimer. Here we report studies on the influence of aa substitutions in the DQ beta 1*0201 chain on DQ2-restricted T-cell recognition of gluten antigens. A B-LCL expressing the DQ(alpha 1*501, beta 1*0301) heterodimer was transfected with the DQB1*0201 gene, or with DQB1*0201 genes altered by site-directed mutagenesis. Surface expression of the wild-type or mutated DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) heterodimers was observed in the transfectants. Seven DQ2-restricted, gluten-specific TCCs were then investigated with respect to their ability to recognize antigen presented by the transfectants. All TCCs were sensitive to one or more of the aa substitutions induced but showed different response patterns. The results demonstrate that single aa substitutions of the DQ beta 1*0201 chain at positions in the peptide-binding cleft of DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) may affect binding of gluten-derived peptides and/or interfere with T-cell recognition. Because all seven TCCs studied were differently affected, they probably differ with respect to glutenpeptide and/or DQ(alpha 1*0501, beta 1*0201) restriction fine specificity."

Volume: 12 Issue: 5 1999,1999,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10551997/,"Effects on hyperacute rejection were studied in a discordant model with the platelet GPIIb/IIIa antagonist Reopro. Pig kidneys perfused with human blood survived median 118 min in the Reopro group and 103 min in the controls (P = 0.22). Platelet and leukocyte counts decreased, whereas plasma thrombospondin and soluble as well as platelet membrane P-selectin increased significantly in both groups without significant intergroup differences. beta-Thromboglobulin and myeloperoxidase increased significantly more in the control group than in the Reopro group (P = 0.009 and P = 0.02, respectively). The classical complement pathway was substantially and similarly activated in both groups. Light and electron microscopy revealed arterial thrombi and numerous glomerular platelet aggregates in the control group in contrast to the Reopro group. In conclusion, Reopro reduced platelet aggregation, and platelet and leukocyte activation to some extent, but had no effect on complement activation and did not significantly prolong xenograft survival, even though better preservation of morphology was shown."

Furthermore, 4 weeks after ischemia there was an increased number of regenerating mast cells. An increase in the number of mast cells and morphological signs of granule synthesis in the ventricular or septal muscle of the sham operated controls indicates that the surgical procedure itself can affect the mast cells of the heart generally. Morphological signs of granule synthesis were observed within mast cells of all experimental groups, and the figure was highly increased after 4 weeks of ischemia."

A cross-sectional study was conducted between June and October 2016 among HCWs in tertiary and regional hospitals in Dar es Salaam, Tanzania, to determine the MRSA nasal carriage rate. Nasal swabs were collected from HCWs and cultured on mannitol salt agar. S. aureus was identified based on colonial morphology, Gram staining, catalase, coagulase, and DNase test results. MRSA was detected using the cefoxitin disk. Among 379 HCWs enrolled, 157/379 (41.4%) were colonized with S. aureus, of whom 59 (37.6%) were MRSA carriers giving an overall prevalence of 59/379 (15.6%). MRSA carriage was high among HCWs in Temeke (56.9%) and Amana (37.5%) regional hospitals. A high proportion of MRSA carriage was detected among nurses (35, 45.5%). MRSA isolates showed high resistance toward kanamycin (83.7%), gentamicin (83.1%), ciprofloxacin (71.2%), and trimethoprim-sulphamethoxazole (46.8%) compared to methicillin-sensitive S. aureus isolates (p ≤ 0.001). In conclusion, we found a high nasal carriage of MRSA and resistance to commonly prescribed antimicrobial agents among HCWs. Implementation of infection control measures including contact precautions, urgent reporting of MRSA laboratory results, and routine MRSA screening of HCWs is highly needed to reduce MRSA spreading."

Volume: 70 Issue: 3 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17765401/,"Adjuvant therapy for cancer usually refers to surgery followed by chemotherapy and/or radiation treatment to decrease the risk of recurrence. But still, the absolute benefit for survival obtained with adjuvant therapy compared with control is only approximately 6%. The objective of this analysis is to formulate a non-invasive multimodal cancer treatment system related to cancer stem cells and hypoxic fractions of solid tumors, emphasizing MRI monitoring and guidance, to elevate the therapeutic index. Tumor hypoxia is a therapeutic concern since it can reduce the effectiveness of drugs and radiotherapy, where well oxygenated cells requiring one third of the dose of hypoxic cells to achieve a given level of cell killing. Cancer stem cells might be the cause of tumor recurrence, sometimes many years after the appearance of the successful treatment of a primary tumor. Thus, the primary objective of such a treatment system will be to provide sufficient selective toxicity to both kill cancer stem cells and cells of hypoxic fractions of the tumor. Active tumor targeting with the use of liposomally encapsulated drugs is the starting point of the treatment procedure. The system facilitates quality assurance means by MR monitoring of drug accumulation and drug release, in real time. Cavitation involves the nucleation, growth and oscillation of gaseous cavities. Selective drug release and/or hyperthermia are achieved by ultrasound induced cavitation well defined to the tumor region. Hyperthermic effects, increased vascularization and subsequent increase in pO2 levels to hypoxic regions, can be monitored by MRI. MRI monitoring of key physiological parameters facilitates optimization related to approximate real time concomitant treatments, including correct timing and various combinations of drug therapy, hyperthermia, ionizing radiation, ablation, other treatment options, before or after surgery. The likelihood of an improved therapeutic index with the use of such a system seems compelling. Further research related to optimal timing, combinations of responses between liposomally encapsulated drug dosage, ultrasound exposure, hyperthermia, pO2 response time, ionizing radiation fractionation and treatment time, have to be conducted."

Fifty-seven steroid-naive children (7-16 years old; 41 boys, 16 girls) with EIB participated in this sub-population study according to the following inclusion criterion: a maximum fall in forced expiratory volume in 1 s (FEV1) > or = 10% after a standardized treadmill test. Mean baseline FEV1 was 100.3% of predicted, and mean maximum fall in FEV1 after the standardized exercise test was 22%. The study was a double-blind, randomized, parallel-group design. After 2 weeks of run-in, the children received inhaled budesonide 100 microg or 200 microg once daily in the morning, 100 microg twice daily, or placebo, for 12 weeks. After 12 weeks of treatment, the fall in FEV1 after the exercise test was significantly less in all three budesonide groups (7.2-7.8%) vs. placebo (16.7%). Daytime symptom scores were significantly lower in all three budesonide groups compared with placebo (p <0.02). The three budesonide groups did not differ significantly, and no significant change in lung function was found in any group. Therefore children with mild asthma, but with significant EIB, improved their exercise tolerance and symptom control after 3 months of treatment with a low dose of inhaled budesonide given once or twice daily."

As routine histopathological examination of winter ulcer cases in our laboratory revealed frequent presence in ulcers of long, slender rods clearly different from M. viscosa, a closer study focusing on these bacteria was conducted. Field cases of winter ulcers during 2 sampling periods, 1996 and 2004-2005, were investigated and long, slender rods were observed by histopathological examination in 70 and 62.5% of the ulcers examined, respectively, whereas cultivation on marine agar resulted in the isolation of yellow-pigmented colonies with long rods from 3 and 13% of the ulcers only. The isolates could be separated into 2 groups, both identified as belonging to the genus Tenacibaculum based on phenotypic characterization and 16S rRNA sequencing. Bath challenge for 7 h confirmed the ability of Group 1 bacterium to produce skin and cornea ulcers. In fish already suffering from M. viscosa-induced ulcers, co-infection with the Group 1 bacterium was established within 1 h. Ulcers from field cases of winter ulcers and from the transmission experiments tested positive by immunohistochemistry with polyclonal antiserum against the Group 1 bacterium but not the Group 2 bacterium. Our results strongly indicate the importance of the Group 1 bacterium in the pathogenesis of winter ulcers in Norway. The bacterium is difficult to isolate and is therefore likely to be underdiagnosed based on cultivation only."

Volume: 31 Issue: 26 Jun 29 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21715639/,"The mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) of neural stem cells (NSCs) is vulnerable to oxidation damage. Subtle manipulations of the cellular redox state affect mtDNA integrity in addition to regulating the NSC differentiation lineage, suggesting a molecular link between mtDNA integrity and regulation of differentiation. Here we show that 8-oxoguanine DNA glycosylase (OGG1) is essential for repair of mtDNA damage and NSC viability during mitochondrial oxidative stress. Differentiating neural cells from ogg1(-/-) knock-out mice spontaneously accumulate mtDNA damage and concomitantly shift their differentiation direction toward an astrocytic lineage, similar to wt NSCs subjected to mtDNA damaging insults. Antioxidant treatments reversed mtDNA damage accumulation and separately increased neurogenesis in ogg1(-/-) cells. NSCs from a transgenic ogg1(-/-) mouse expressing mitochondrially targeted human OGG1 were protected from mtDNA damage during differentiation, and displayed elevated neurogenesis. The underlying mechanisms for this shift in differentiation direction involve the astrogenesis promoting Sirt1 via an increased NAD/NADH ratio in ogg1(-/-) cells. Redox manipulations to alter mtDNA damage level correspondingly activated Sirt1 in both cell types. Our results demonstrate for the first time the interdependence between mtDNA integrity and NSC differentiation fate, suggesting that mtDNA damage is the primary signal for the elevated astrogliosis and lack of neurogenesis seen during repair of neuronal injury."

707,Lasting effects of snow accumulation on summer performance of large herbivores in alpine ecosystems may not last.,24164593,The Journal of animal ecology. Volume: 83 Issue: 3 May 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24164593/,"One of the clearest predictions from the IPCC is that we can expect much less snow cover due to global warming in the 21st century, especially in the lower alpine areas. In alpine ecosystems, snow accumulation in depressions gives rise to distinct snow-bed vegetation types, assumed to play a key role in ecosystem function. A delayed plant phenology yields high-quality forage in late summer for wild and domestic herbivores. Yet, the mechanistic pathways for how declining snow may affect future performance of large herbivores beyond the effect of phenology remain poorly documented. Here, we link unique individual-based data on diet choice, habitat selection and performance of domestic sheep over a 10-year period to manually GPS-recorded spatial positions of snow cover in early summer (0.57% to 43.3% in snow beds on 1st of July) in an alpine ecosystem. Snowy winters gave a higher proportion of easily digestible herbs in the diet and a more variable use of snow-bed and meadow vegetation types resulting in faster growing lambs. These patterns were consistent between two density treatment levels although slightly more marked for diet at low density, suggesting that effects of simple mitigation efforts such as managing population numbers will be meagre. Our study thus yields novel insight into the strong impact of melting snow on ecosystem function in alpine habitats, which are likely to affect productivity of both domestic and wild ungulate populations."

Four pairs of sequence repeats of 8 to 13 base-pairs in length were revealed close to the cohesive ends. These repeats possibly represent signal sequences involved in phage DNA maturation and packaging. The start of an open reading frame was localized only 42 nucleotides from the left end of the phi LC3 phage double-stranded region, implying that transcription probably proceeds across the cos site. Compilation of the characteristics of the DNA termini of bacteriophages with complementary cohesive DNA ends suggests that phages of Gram-negative bacteria generally carry 5'-protruding single-strands whereas those of Gram-positive hosts carry 3'-protruding ends."

They concluded that temperature played a significant role in bear habitat selection and that it was unlikely that human activity introduced biases to the habitat selection of bears. However, Pigeon et al. did not consider variables related to human activities in their analyses. They also misinterpreted previous research that has accounted for temperature in the habitat selection of brown bears. There is much literature published on the negative effects of human disturbance on wildlife in general and on bears in particular. Downplaying the role of human disturbance could have important negative consequences if, in fact, human disturbance were a more important factor than thermoregulation. Indeed, dismissing the importance of human influence, in the face of contradictory evidence, could tempt managers to disregard an important factor that is difficult and often unpopular to deal with in their conservation plans."

Gender differences in sleep patterns and insomnia, as well as a comparison of insomnia rates according to DSM-IV, DSM-V and quantitative criteria for insomnia (Behav. Res. Ther., 41, 2003, 427), were explored. We used a large population-based study in Hordaland county in Norway, conducted in 2012. The sample included 10,220 adolescents aged 16-18 years (54% girls). Self-reported sleep measurements included bedtime, rise time, time in bed, sleep duration, sleep efficiency, sleep onset latency, wake after sleep onset, rate and frequency and duration of difficulties initiating and maintaining sleep and rate and frequency of tiredness and sleepiness. The adolescents reported short sleep duration on weekdays (mean 6:25 hours), resulting in a sleep deficiency of about 2 h. A majority of the adolescents (65%) reported sleep onset latency exceeding 30 min. Girls reported longer sleep onset latency and a higher rate of insomnia than boys, while boys reported later bedtimes and a larger weekday-weekend discrepancy on several sleep parameters. Insomnia prevalence rates ranged from a total prevalence of 23.8 (DSM-IV criteria), 18.5 (DSM-V criteria) and 13.6% (quantitative criteria for insomnia). We conclude that short sleep duration, long sleep onset latency and insomnia were prevalent in adolescents. This warrants attention as a public health concern in this age group."

Recently, the method has been employed by several laboratories for investigations of clinical and foodborne isolates of Listeria monocytogenes. To assess the sensitivity and reproducibility of MEE in characterising L. monocytogenes isolates for epidemiological purposes and, ultimately, to agree on a standard protocol, seven laboratories participated in a blinded study of 80 strains. The strain collection included both epidemiologically related and unrelated isolates. Each laboratory used its own protocol for MEE. The number of enzymes that were assayed by the laboratories ranged from 8 to 23, and the total number of identified electrophoretic types (ETs) varied between 14 and 25. Of the II pairs of duplicate strains, the number of pairs recognised as identical by the seven laboratories ranged from 3 to 10 (median = 8). From 10 to 18 (median = 15) of the 22 groups of epidemiological related strains were recognised as homogeneous by the different laboratories. The discriminatory power of the method, calculated using Simpson's index of diversity for 69 strains (80 strains minus the 11 duplicates), ranged from 0.827 to 0.925. This relatively low discriminatory power is a consequence of a somewhat low genetic diversity of L. monocytogenes compared to other bacterial species. Efforts should be pursued to standardise the method in order to improve the intra- and inter-laboratory reproducibility."

A proteoglycan undergoes different modifications en route to the apical and basolateral surfaces of Madin-Darby canine kidney cells. J Biol Chem 280: 29596-29603). To investigate whether the domain with GAG attachment sites in SG (i) is sufficient to drive apical protein sorting and (ii) independently generates the sulfation differences observed in the apical and basolateral pathways, the GAG domain of SG was fused into the junction of rat growth hormone (rGH) and GFP and expressed in MDCK cells, either with or without two N-glycosylation sites in the rGH part. Both variants acquired chondroitin sulfate GAG chains and were secreted predominantly to the apical medium, to the same extent as rGH-GFP with two N-glycosylation sites only, and different from the nonsorted variant lacking glycosylation sites. Transfer of the GAG attachment domain from SG to the new rGH context abolished the differences in sulfation intensity and positions observed for SG in the apical and basolateral secretory routes. Thus, these differences are coded by elements outside the GAG attachment domain."

The aim of this study was to assess the viability and osteogenic differentiation of primary human osteoblasts and adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells from various donors on titanium dioxide (TiO2) scaffolds coated with an alginate hydrogel enriched with enamel matrix derivative. Cells were harvested for quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction on days 14 and 21, and medium was collected on days 2, 14, and 21 for protein analyses. Neither coating with alginate hydrogel nor alginate hydrogel enriched with enamel matrix derivative induced a cytotoxic response. Enamel matrix derivative-enriched alginate hydrogel significantly increased the expression of osteoblast markers COL1A1, TNFRSF11B, and BGLAP and secretion of osteopontin in human osteoblasts, whereas osteogenic differentiation of human adipose tissue-derived mesenchymal stem cells seemed unaffected by enamel matrix derivative. The alginate hydrogel coating procedure may have potential for local delivery of enamel matrix derivative and other stimulatory factors for use in bone tissue engineering. "

PNS are mediated by immune reactions against autoantigen(s) shared by the cancer cells and the nervous system. By serological screening of a rat cerebellum cDNA expression library using anti-Hu-positive sera from three patients with paraneoplastic encephalomyelitis (PEM), we identified an open reading frame encoding an isoform of the BTB-kelch protein KLHL7. Immunohistochemical studies demonstrated that the KLHL7 protein is expressed in the nuclei of neurones, but not in other tissues including various cancers. However, the KLHL7 protein was detected in the nuclei of cancer cell lines. Antibodies to KLHL7 were detected by an immunoprecipitation assay in sera from 12 of 254 (4.7%) patients with various cancers and 2 of 170 blood donors (1.2%). None of 50 sera from patients with multiple sclerosis were positive for KLHL7 antibodies. Sixteen patients with classical PNS and anti-Hu or anti-Yo antibodies were also negative for KLHL7 antibodies. Seven cancer patients with KLHL7 antibodies had various signs of neurological disease that could be related to cancer, whereas the remaining five seropositive cancer patients had no clinical signs of possible PNS. The present results indicate that KLHL7 antibodies are associated with various cancers, and in some patients also with neurological disease. Whether KLHL7 antibodies can be used as paraneoplastic markers for PNS remains to be determined."

Volume: 290 Issue: 5 May 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16339833/,"We used a longitudinal study design (gestational weeks 8, 15, 22, 29, and 36 and 12 wk postpartum ) to investigate the effect of normal pregnancy on cerebral autoregulation and pressor response. Blood flow velocities in the right internal carotid artery, end-tidal CO2, and mean arterial pressure (MAP) were simultaneously and continuously recorded in 16 healthy pregnant women during standardized hyperventilation and handgrip. Blood flow velocities were recorded using Doppler ultrasound sampled beat by beat using the ECG signal. The results demonstrate that the vasoconstrictor response to hyperventilation is unchanged during pregnancy. During standardized handgrip, MAP showed a statistically significant increase during pregnancy that did not affect cerebral blood flow. A statistically significant reduction in the MAP response to handgrip was seen in week 36. In conclusion, pregnancy has no impact on cerebral autoregulation. There is an impact on the pressor response resulting in a blunted reaction at week 36, probably caused by a fall in the baroreflex set point."

This study investigated muscle function and muscle fibre morphology after a single bout of low-intensity resistance exercise with and without BFR. Twelve physically active subjects performed unilateral knee extensions at 30% of their one repetition maximum (1RM), with partial BFR on one leg and the other leg without occlusion. With the BFR leg, five sets were performed to concentric torque failure, and the free-flow leg repeated the exact same number of repetitions and sets. Biopsies were obtained from vastus lateralis before and 1, 24 and 48 h after exercise. Maximum isometric torque (MVC) and resting tension were measured before and after exercise and at 4, 24, 48, 72, 96 and 168 h post-exercise. The results demonstrated significant decrements in MVC (lasting ≥48 h) and delayed onset muscle soreness in both legs, and increased resting tension for the occluded leg both acutely and at 24 h post-exercise. The percentage of muscle fibres showing elevated intracellular staining of the plasma protein tetranectin, a marker for sarcolemmal permeability, was significantly increased from 9% before exercise to 27-38% at 1, 24 and 48 h post-exercise for the BFR leg. The changes in the free-flow leg were significant only at 24 h (19%). We conclude that an acute bout of low-load resistance exercise with BFR resulted in changes suggesting muscle damage, which may have implications both for safety aspects and for the training stimulus with BFR exercise."

This information was used to search for any effects of trawling on the benthic fauna. Two stations where located in a trawled area, and two stations where in a protected area. Diversity (H') varied from 2.01 to 3.52 in the trawled area and from 2.13 to 2.78 in the protected area. Diversity was generally higher in the trawled area, and this was in contradiction to what we would have expected from other studies where the trend has been that trawling reduces diversity. Brittlestars and lancelets seemed to be the groups mostly harmed by the trawling, while amphipods where more abundant in trawled areas. The multivariate analyses did not reveal the patterns of faunal change as well as we hoped. This is surely because of our lack of more replicate samples. The multivariate analyses are easily confounded when few sites are analyzed. We have found differences in the type of fauna found in trawled and protected areas and, considering the differences in environmental variables in our stations and our lack of replication, this indicates that there are differences and a larger investigation is in order to reveal its magnitude."

Volume: 75 Issue: 5 1997,1997,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9551185/,"Nuclear localization signals (NLSs) are short peptides required for nuclear transport of karyophilic proteins. We review in this paper how the nuclear targeting property of NLS peptides has been taken advantage of to enhance the efficiency of nuclear uptake of transgene DNA in zebrafish and how it may improve the efficiency of transgenesis in this species. Synthetic NLS peptides can bind to plasmid DNA by ionic interactions. Cytoplasmic injection of DNA-NLS complexes in zebrafish eggs enhances the rate and the amount of plasmid DNA taken up by embryonic nuclei. Nuclear import of DNA-NLS complexes has been duplicated in vitro and exhibits energetic and cytosolic requirements similar to those for nuclear protein import. Furthermore, binding NLSs to DNA increases expression frequency of the transgene. We suggest that NLS peptides may constitute a valuable tool to improve the efficiency of transgenesis in zebrafish and other species."

Volume: 1 Issue: 5 May 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12871375/,"Epinephrine is known to enhance lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced interleukin (IL)-8 secretion in a platelet dependent manner. To determine whether thromboxane A2 (TxA2; a product from activated platelets) is involved in this process, blood samples drawn either before or 2 h after oral administration of 440 mg acetylsalicylic acid (ASA) were stimulated with LPS (5 ng mL(-1)) and different concentrations of epinephrine were added (0.1-100.0 micromol L(-1)). ASA ingestion significantly (global P < 0.05) reduced the enhancing effect of epinephrine on LPS-induced IL-8 release by 15-28%. To further explore whether TxA2 may be involved in this process, a TxA2 agonist (U46619) was added to whole blood together with LPS instead of epinephrine. U46619 mimicked the epinephrine effect: 20 ng mL(-1) U46619 enhanced LPS-induced IL-8 release by 39% (P < 0.05). Furthermore, preincubation of whole blood with 75 micro mol L-1 or 150 micromol L(-1) SQ29548, a TxA2 receptor antagonist, completely blocked epinephrine's promoting effect on LPS-induced IL-8 release. Since thrombin-activated platelets have been reported to be important in the production of IL-8 in monocytes through the activation of monocytes by exposed RANTES in a P-selectin-dependent reaction, we suggest that the epinephrine effect is mediated by enhanced TxA2 production and subsequent rise in the exposure of RANTES and P-selectin on the platelets of whole blood."

Transport of this peptide across the BBB was determined using an in vitro model of the human BBB, which utilizes the human cerebral microvascular endothelial cell line (hCMEC/D3). Uptake and transport of 5-FAM-PPL across the hCMEC/D3 cell model was determined using confocal microscopy and mass spectrometry. This is an important parameter in determining whether peptides may reach the target organ (i.e., the brain and central nervous system).This work assessed, for the first time, the ability of a food-derived PEP inhibitory peptide to cross the BBB without the use of animal models.

The salmon were then translocated and exposed to 90% and 130% O2 saturation for additional 72 days during smoltification. TBARS and vitamin E levels in liver and the levels of oxidized glutathione (GSSG), total glutathione (GSH) and the resulting oxidative stress index (OSI) in blood were quantified as traditional oxidative stress markers. No significant mean normalized expression (MNE) differences of SOD, CAT or GSH-Px were found in liver after hyperoxia exposure at the two sampling times. Significantly decreased OSI was found in smolt exposed to 130% O2 saturation after 126 days (n = 18, P < 0.0001), indicating hyperoxia-induced oxidative stress. No effects were seen on growth, or on the levels of thiobarbituric reactive substances (TBARS) and vitamin E in liver after the exposure experiment. Overall, the mRNA expression of SOD, CAT and GSH-Px in liver related poorly with the hyperoxic exposure regimes, and more knowledge are needed before the expressed levels of these antioxidant genes can be applied as biomarkers of hyperoxia in Atlantic salmon."

We compared a small population with low selection pressure, a large population with high selection pressure, and a large population with moderate selection pressure. Single seed descent was compared with S0-derived recurrent selection. Optimal contribution selection achieved higher index and lower population coancestry than truncation selection, which reached a plateau in index improvement after 40 years in the large population with high selection pressure. With optimal contribution selection, index doubled in 38 years in the small population with low selection pressure and 27-28 years in the large population with moderate selection pressure. Single seed descent increased the rate of improvement in index per cycle but also increased cycle time."

Adsorbed TTAB has conformational disorder similar to free TTAB at about 70 °C, with an increase in the rate of conformational changes occurring above 50 °C. Furthermore, no significant change in TTAB adsorption density was observed in the temperature range studied, and the results indicate a bilayer arrangement of the adsorbed surfactants. The number of gauche conformers increases linearly with temperature for the alkyl chain carbons in TTAB micelles. However, the total increase in gauche conformers is significantly smaller for micellar than for adsorbed TTAB within the temperature range studied. The fraction of micellized TTAB molecules in solution is found to increase with temperature. "

Both moieties are known to mediate cell attachment to various foreign surfaces. Five strongly metastatic and 5 weakly metastatic cell clones from a murine fibrosarcoma were examined for the occurrence of both cell-surface moieties by immunofluorescence flow cytometry and microscopy. None of these clones was rich in laminin-like molecules, which were least strongly expressed by the highly metastatic clones. The alpha-D-galactopyranosyl end-groups were strongly expressed by all strongly metastatic clones and by 2 weakly metastatic clones, but were only weakly expressed by the other weakly metastatic clones. These results indicate that the laminin-like cell-surface molecules are not necessary for spontaneous metastasis formation. However, the alpha-D-galactopyranosyl end-groups may be necessary, but are not sufficient for the cancer cells to form metastases. These carbohydrates are known to occur on the laminin-like molecules. The present results show that they must also exist on other cell-surface molecules."

Volume: 85 Aug 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26094042/,"Body size directly influences an animal's place in the natural world, including its energy requirements, home range size, relative brain size, locomotion, diet, life history, and behavior. Thus, an understanding of the biology of extinct organisms, including species in our own lineage, requires accurate estimates of body size. Since the last major review of hominin body size based on postcranial morphology over 20 years ago, new fossils have been discovered, species attributions have been clarified, and methods improved. Here, we present the most comprehensive and thoroughly vetted set of individual fossil hominin body mass predictions to date, and estimation equations based on a large (n = 220) sample of modern humans of known body masses. We also present species averages based exclusively on fossils with reliable taxonomic attributions, estimates of species averages by sex, and a metric for levels of sexual dimorphism. Finally, we identify individual traits that appear to be the most reliable for mass estimation for each fossil species, for use when only one measurement is available for a fossil. Our results show that many early hominins were generally smaller-bodied than previously thought, an outcome likely due to larger estimates in previous studies resulting from the use of large-bodied modern human reference samples. Current evidence indicates that modern human-like large size first appeared by at least 3-3.5 Ma in some Australopithecus afarensis individuals. Our results challenge an evolutionary model arguing that body size increased from Australopithecus to early Homo. Instead, we show that there is no reliable evidence that the body size of non-erectus early Homo differed from that of australopiths, and confirm that Homo erectus evolved larger average body size than earlier hominins.

Volume: 252 Suppl 1 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7734979/,"Secretory immunity is central in primary defense of the airway mucosa. B cells involved in this local immune system are initially stimulated in mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue, including tonsils and adenoids, and then migrate to secretory effector sites where they become immunoglobulin (Ig)-producing plasma cells. Locally produced Ig consists mainly of J-chain-containing dimers and larger polymers of IgA (pIgA) that are selectively transported through glandular cells by an epithelial receptor called secretory component or pIgR. Secretory antibodies perform surface protection by immune exclusion of soluble antigens as well as infectious agents. IgG can also participate in this primary defense because it reaches secretions by passive diffusion similar to IgE. However, the inflammatory properties of antibodies belonging to the latter two classes explain their involvement in mucosal immunopathology when elimination of penetrating antigens is unsuccessful. T helper (Th) cells activated in this process may by a Th2 profile of cytokines promote persistent inflammation with extravasation and priming of eosinophils. This mechanism appears to occur in the late-phase allergic reaction, perhaps driven mainly by interleukin-4 (IL-4) released from mast cells subjected to IgE-mediated degranulation. Eosinophils are potentially tissue-destructive cells, particularly after priming with IL-5. Cytokines also up-regulate adhesion molecules on vascular endothelium and epithelium, thereby enhancing migration of eosinophils and other leukocytes into the mucosa.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Here, we show that LC3 can also redistribute toward the damaged Golgi apparatus where it clusters with SQSTM1/p62 and lysosomes. This organelle-specific relocation, which did not involve the generation of double-membraned autophagosomes, could be observed after Golgi damage was induced by various strategies, namely (i) laser-induced localized cellular damage, (ii) local expression of peroxidase and exposure to peroxide and diaminobenzidine, (iii) treatment with the Golgi-tropic photosensitizer redaporfin and light, (iv) or exposure to the Golgi-tropic anticancer peptidomimetic LTX-401. Mechanistic exploration led to the conclusion that both reactive oxygen species-dependent and -independent Golgi damage induces a similar phenotype that depended on ATG5 yet did not depend on phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase catalytic subunit type 3 and Beclin-1. Interestingly, knockout of ATG5 sensitized cells to Golgi damage-induced cell death, suggesting that the pathway culminating in the relocation of LC3 to the damaged Golgi may have a cytoprotective function."

Next, we investigated whether urinary/serum MMP/TIMP levels are elevated during acute subclinical tubulitis in surveillance biopsies obtained within the first 6months post-transplant (n=25). Compared to biopsies with normal histology, serum MMPs/TIMPs were not different; however, all urinary MMP/TIMP levels were numerically higher during subclinical tubulitis (MMP-1, MMP-7, TIMP-1 with p≤0.04). We conclude that urinary/serum MMPs/TIMPs do hardly correlate with existing or early developing IF/TA in surveillance biopsies obtained within the first 6months post-transplant. This could be explained by the dynamic process of extracellular matrix remodeling, which seems to be active during acute tubulo-interstitial injury/inflammation, but not in quiescent IF/TA. "

Volume: 228 Issue: 5 Nov 1990,1990,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2254715/,"Continuous subcutaneous insulin infusion (CSII) and multiple injections (MI) have been shown to have metabolic advantages in highly-selected insulin-dependent diabetics (IDDs), but there have been few comparative studies in self-selected IDDs. With MI, the optimal insulin preparation for overnight insulin delivery has not been defined. We compared conventional 2-3 injection therapy (CT), CSII and MI with human isophane insulin (MI/human isophane) and human ultralente insulin (MI/human ultralente), respectively, at bedtime in self-selected IDDs. Of 275 IDDs who were invited to participate, 52 individuals (18.9%) entered the study. Most indices of glycaemic control showed better values on CSII and also on MI compared to CT, but the differences were small. Fasting blood glucose was higher on MI/human ultralente than on MI/human isophane. Only one subcutaneous abscess and one case of ketoacidosis requiring hospitalization occurred on CSII. Serious hypoglycaemic episodes were non-significantly increased on intensified therapy. Most patients clearly preferred intensified insulin therapy; approximately one half CSII."

Volume: 47 Issue: 4 Apr 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25751625/,"Genome-wide association studies (GWAS) and large-scale replication studies have identified common variants in 79 loci associated with breast cancer, explaining ∼14% of the familial risk of the disease. To identify new susceptibility loci, we performed a meta-analysis of 11 GWAS, comprising 15,748 breast cancer cases and 18,084 controls together with 46,785 cases and 42,892 controls from 41 studies genotyped on a 211,155-marker custom array (iCOGS). Analyses were restricted to women of European ancestry. We generated genotypes for more than 11 million SNPs by imputation using the 1000 Genomes Project reference panel, and we identified 15 new loci associated with breast cancer at P < 5 × 10(-8). Combining association analysis with ChIP-seq chromatin binding data in mammary cell lines and ChIA-PET chromatin interaction data from ENCODE, we identified likely target genes in two regions: SETBP1 at 18q12.3 and RNF115 and PDZK1 at 1q21.1. One association appears to be driven by an amino acid substitution encoded in EXO1. "

Issue: 69 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16355603/,"This presentation will focus on motor competence, the clumsy child, perceptual deficits in clumsy children and possible neurological dysfunction in this group of children. Motor competence not only allows children to carry out everyday practical tasks, but it is also an important determinant of their level of self-esteem and of their popularity and status in their peer group. Research has shown that about 6-10% of children have motor competences well below the norm. It is unusual for motor problems to simply disappear over time. In the absence of intervention the syndrome is likely to manifest itself. In the clinical literature attempts have been made to establish causal links between surface manifestations of clumsiness and underlying perceptual deficits. In this respect the attention is primarily directed towards the concept of inter- and intra-modal matching, particularly with respect to vision and proprioception, an ability deemed to underlie many real-life motor skills. Neurobehavioural model of inter- and intra-modal matching and deficit model is presented. Findings from studies using this paradigm are discussed and it is argued that clumsiness must be seen as a neurological dysfunction (insufficiency)."

Time-domain molecular imaging of NTR/CytoCy5S reporter platform permitted noninvasive monitoring of disease progression in orthotopic xenografts of disseminated leukemia, lung, and metastatic breast cancer. This methodology facilitated therapeutic evaluation of NTR gene-directed enzymatic prodrug therapy with conventional metronidazole antibiotics. These studies show NTR/CytoCy5S as a near-infrared gene reporter system with broad preclinical and prospective clinical applications within imaging, and gene therapy, of cancer."

In vitro: BT4C-cells were treated with different concentrations of cisplatin or carboplatin, with or without simultaneous hyperthermia. In vivo: Inbred BD IX rats with transplanted glioma-like BT4A or glioblastoma-like BT4An tumors on the hind leg were treated with cisplatin (4 mg/kg) or carboplatin (50 mg/kg), with or without local hyperthermia. In vitro the benefit of adding hyperthermia to chemotherapy was similar for cisplatin and carboplatin. For both cisplatin and carboplatin, the difference of treatment effect between thermochemotherapy and chemotherapy alone increased with higher drug concentrations. In vivo hyperthermia clearly enhanced the effect of carboplatin on BT4A tumors. When treating BT4An tumors, thermochemotherapy with cisplatin or carboplatin was equally effective. Both combinations were superior to treatment with hyperthermia alone. Local toxicity and weight loss following thermochemotherapy were comparable when substituting cisplatin with carboplatin."

Volume: 2012 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22548065/,"Little attention has been given to how microRNA expression is affected by environmental contaminants exposure. We investigate the effects of paternal exposure to benzo[a]pyrene (B[a]P) on miRNA expression in the developing mouse embryo. Male mice were exposed to B[a]P (150 mg/kg i.p.), and their sperm was used four days later in in-vitro fertilization experiments. Twenty embryos each from 2-, 8-cell and the blastocyst stage were used for genome-wide miRNA expression profiling. Paternal exposure to B[a]P affected the expression of several miRNAs, and the target genes for some of the dysregulated miRNAs were enriched in many different pathways that are likely to be relevant for the developing mouse embryo. By linking the miRNA target genes to publicly available databases, we identified some miRNA target genes that may serve as global markers of B[a]P-mediated genotoxic stress. The dysregulated miRNAs may provide valuable knowledge about potential transgenerational effects of sublethal exposure to chemicals."

Prioritising on the basis of cost-per-QALY misses the former point. The trade-off between severity and treatment effect can be expressed in terms of equivalence of numbers for different outcomes. The present study suggests that this trade-off can be modeled mathematically with reasonable accuracy. A table that expresses social equivalence numbers as a function of severity and treatment effect could be used together with guidelines for adjusting for age, duration and risk to estimate the social value of any outcome. In this valuation, saving a young person from dying to a life as healthy (= 1 SAVE) is suggested as the unit of measurement. Cost per SAVE may then be useful as a guiding criterion in prioritising."

Those in the SHPT group had significantly impaired performance in 3 of 14 cognitive tests (Digit span forward, Stroop test part 1 and 2, and Word association test (FAS)) as compared with the controls, and also had a significantly higher depression score at the Beck Depression Inventory (BDI) (items 1-13). In a multiple linear regression model, a high serum PTH level was significantly associated with low performance at the Digit span forward, Stroop test part 1 and 2, and Digit Symbol tests. A low level of serum 25-hydroxyvitamin D was significantly associated with a high depression score. In conclusion, a deranged calcium metabolism appears to be associated with impaired function in several tests of neuropsychological function."
