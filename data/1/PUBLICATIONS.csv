1,"The effect of 1,25-vitamin D3 on maturation of monocytes from HIV-infected patients varies with degree of immunodeficiency.",8920807,"APMIS : acta pathologica, microbiologica, et immunologica Scandinavica. Volume: 104 Issue: 7-8",,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8920807/,"The active metabolite of vitamin D, 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (1,25D), has been shown to induce monocyte-to-macrophage maturation in vitro as well as monocytic differentiation of bone marrow precursors and monocytic leukaemic cell lines. In this study we assessed whether 1,25D could improve the maturation defect we have previously demonstrated in monocytes from AIDS patients. In vitro growth and maturation of monocytes from 10 controls, 15 asymptomatic HIV positives (CDC group II or III) and 13 symptomatic HIV positives (CDC group IV) was examined by assessing cellular morphology, differentiation, adherence and protein content. Cells were cultured for 10 days with or without addition of 1,25D at a concentration of 100 pg/ml. In addition, patients were monitored clinically and by immunological parameters and HIV p24 antigen in serum. The present study showed that addition of 1,25D significantly improved the growth and maturation in both patient and control groups. There was a significant negative correlation between response to 1,25D and CD4+ lymphocyte count in blood in HIV-infected patients. A greater response to 1,25D was seen in monocytes from patients with advanced immunodeficiency and symptomatic disease than in monocytes from asymptomatic patients. However, in the most advanced cases of HIV infection with serious ongoing opportunistic infections the response to 1,25D was very poor, possibly reflecting profound and incorrigible dysfunction of monocytes."
2,Clinical confidence following an interprofessional educational program on eating disorders for health care professionals: a qualitative analysis.,22936849,Journal of multidisciplinary healthcare. Volume: 5 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22936849/,"There are an increasing number of educational programs to improve clinical competence and skills to treat mental disorders. For complex disorders there is also a focus on improving the quality of interprofessional work. This paper reports on interprofessional outputs of an educational program on eating disorders. A total of 207 professionals who completed the program were requested to describe up to 12 possible scenarios depicted as realistic prospects for their future work within this field. Analyzing the scenarios resulted in three categories of describing the participants' preferences: (1) interprofessional interventions and treatment; (2) the further development of competence; and (3) organization of the health care system. The findings showed that the participants were considering working across new lines in their current workplaces or crossing borders to new frontiers in the execution of competence. Our findings may be summarized into the concept of ""clinical confidence."" This concept has so far been understood as some kind of personal trait, disposition, or attitude. The present findings add nuances to this concept in terms of state-dependent encouragement, engagement, and a potential to act and to cross professional borders in order to better treat complex mental disorders."

8,Subcellular localisation and induction of NADH-sensitive acetyl-CoA hydrolase and propionyl-CoA hydrolase activities in rat liver under lipogenic conditions after treatment with sulfur-substituted fatty acids.,7696329,Biochimica et biophysica acta. Volume: 1255 Issue: 2 Mar 16 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7696329/,"The effects of sulfur-substituted fatty acid analogues on the subcellular distribution and activities of acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA hydrolases in rats fed a high carbohydrate diet were studied. Among subcellular fractions of liver homogenates from rats fed a high carbohydrate diet (20%), the acetyl-CoA and propionyl-CoA hydrolase activities are found in the mitochondrial, peroxisome-enriched and cytosolic fractions. We have shown that the subcellular distribution of acetyl-CoA hydrolase appears to be different from the distribution propionyl-CoA hydrolase activity. Thus, the highest specific activity of acetyl-CoA hydrolase was found in the mitochondrial fraction, whereas the highest specific activity of propionyl-CoA hydrolase was found in the peroxisome-enriched fraction. Rats treated with sulfur-substituted fatty acids, i.e., 3-thiadicarboxylic acid (400 mg/day per kg body weight), showed a significant increase in acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity where the peroxisomal and cytosolic hydrolases were increased 3.9- and 2.7-fold, respectively, compared to palmitic acid treated rats. Similar results were obtained with tetradecylthioacetic acid treated rats. Propionyl-CoA hydrolase activities, in rats treated with these two peroxisome proliferating fatty acid analogues showed increased activity mainly in the mitochondrial and the cytosolic subcellular fractions. Acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity was sensitive to NADH, whereas no stimulation of the propionyl-CoA hydrolase activity was observed in the presence of NADH. The hepatic amounts of acetyl-CoA, propionyl-CoA, and free CoASH were elevated after sulfur-substituted fatty acid treatment. Sulfur-substituted fatty acids also elevated the specific acetyl-CoA hydrolase activity in the mitochondrial fraction and the propionyl-CoA hydrolase activity in the light-mitochondrial fraction. These results, therefore, suggest that acetyl-CoA hydrolase and propionyl-CoA hydrolase are two distinct proteins and that these two enzymes have a multiorganelle localisation."
9,Can persistent drop foot after calf muscle lengthening be predicted preoperatively?,19857817,The Journal of foot and ankle surgery : official publication of the American College of Foot and Ankle Surgeons. Volume: 48 Issue: 6,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19857817/,"Calf muscle lengthening usually corrects equinus gait satisfactorily in stance. While in swing, the foot remains in drop foot in approximately half the limbs. The aim of this study was to evaluate if any preoperative clinical findings or kinematic and kinetic data could predict the outcome regarding drop foot. The study included 34 children with cerebral palsy. The average age was 9.3 years. Only children with preoperative maximum ankle dorsiflexion in stance and maximum ankle dorsiflexion in swing more than 2 standard deviations below the normal mean were included. The children underwent preoperative and postoperative clinical examination and gait analysis. Forty calf muscle lengthenings were performed (26 tendo-achilles lengthenings, 14 gastrocnemius recessions). Nineteen of 40 limbs remained in drop foot despite satisfactory correction in stance. There was a significant association between postoperative drop foot and increased preoperative maximum plantar flexion in initial swing (P = .004; odds ratio, 0.906). A limited number of tests of preoperative selective motor control of dorsiflexion of the ankle indicated that normal function is strongly indicative of postoperative normal swing phase. There were no significant associations between postoperative drop foot and preoperative clinical findings, gait function, type of gait pattern, type of cerebral palsy, and type of operation. Preoperative maximum plantar flexion in an initial swing of less than -42 degrees and a preoperative normal selective motor control of dorsiflexion of the ankle are strongly indicative of postoperative normal swing phase. A lower selective motor control score rather than normal function is not predictive of either normal swing or drop foot."

A random sample of 1,933 men aged 22-54 years in Bergen, Norway, were invited into the survey. Smoking habits and measurements of FEV1 were recorded at the initial survey in 1965-1970 (n = 1,591) and at follow-up in 1988-1990 (n = 951). Past or present self-reported occupational exposures to eleven airborne agents (dusts, gases, vapours and fumes) and measurements of FVC were recorded at follow-up only. The decline in FEV1 was associated (p < 0.001) with age, body height and smoking. Smoking cessation reduced the decline to the level of lifetime nonsmokers. Accelerated decline in FEV1 was observed in subjects exposed to sulphur dioxide gas and to metal fumes. The adjusted decline in FEV1 increased progressively in subjects exposed to increasing numbers of occupational agents (test for trend: p < 0.01). Airflow limitation was observed in 9.5% at follow-up, and increased with age and cigarette consumption. In this community follow-up survey in men, smoking and occupational exposures to sulphur dioxide gas, metal fumes and the numbers of specific agents were found to be important predictors for accelerated decline in FEV1."

17,Paraneoplastic CDR2 and CDR2L antibodies affect Purkinje cell calcium homeostasis.,25341622,Acta neuropathologica. Volume: 128 Issue: 6 Dec 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25341622/,"Paraneoplastic cerebellar degeneration (PCD) is characterized by loss of Purkinje cells (PCs) associated with progressive pancerebellar dysfunction in the presence of onconeural Yo antibodies. These antibodies recognize the cerebellar degeneration-related antigens CDR2 and CDR2L. Response to PCD therapy is disappointing due to limited understanding of the neuropathological mechanisms. Here, we report the pathological role of CDR antibodies on the calcium homeostasis in PCs. We developed an antibody-mediated PCD model based on co-incubation of cerebellar organotypic slice culture with human patient serum or rabbit CDR2 and CDR2L antibodies. The CDR antibody-induced pathology was investigated by high-resolution multiphoton imaging and biochemical analysis. Both human and rabbit CDR antibodies were rapidly internalized by PCs and led to reduced immunoreactivity of calbindin D28K (CB) and L7/Pcp-2 as well as reduced dendritic arborizations in the remaining PCs. Washout of the CDR antibodies partially recovered CB immunoreactivity, suggesting a transient structural change in CB calcium-binding site. We discovered that CDR2 and CB co-immunoprecipitate. Furthermore, the expression levels of voltage-gated calcium channel Cav2.1, protein kinase C gamma and calcium-dependent protease, calpain-2, were increased after CDR antibody internalization. Inhibition of these signaling pathways prevented or attenuated CDR antibody-induced CB and L7/Pcp-2 immunoreactivity loss, morphological changes and increased protein expression. These results signify that CDR antibody internalization causes dysregulation of cell calcium homeostasis. Hence, drugs that modulate these events may represent novel neuroprotective therapies that limit the damaging effects of CDR antibodies and prevent PC neurodegeneration. "
18,"Cost-effectiveness analysis of an early-initiated, continuous chain of rehabilitation after severe traumatic brain injury.",24720788,Journal of neurotrauma. Volume: 31 Issue: 14 Jul 15 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24720788/,"The aim of this study is to estimate the long-term cost-effectiveness of two different rehabilitation trajectories after severe traumatic brain injury (sTBI). A decision tree model compared hospitalization costs, health effects, and incremental cost-effectiveness ratios (ICER) of a continuous chain versus a broken chain of rehabilitation. The expected costs were estimated by the reimbursement system using diagnosis-related group and based on point estimates of the Disability Rating Scale (DRS); the health effects were measured by means of area under the curve (AUC). The incremental health benefit was estimated as the difference in the AUCs between the chains. Lower values on the DRS scale indicate better health; thus, smaller AUCs were preferred. The modeled population was a cohort of 59 patients with sTBI (30 in continuous chain; 29 in broken chain) with 6-weeks, 1-year, and 5-year post-injury follow-ups. Regarding the DRS estimates, 5-year AUCs were 19.40 (continuous chain) and 23.46 (broken chain). Across 5 years, the continuous chain of rehabilitation had lower costs and better health effects. By replacing the broken chain with the continuous chain, NOK 37.000 could be saved and 4.06 DRS points gained. By means of probabilistic sensitivity analysis, the majority of ICER estimates (67% of the Monte Carlo simulations) indicated that a continuous chain of rehabilitation was less costly and more effective. These findings indicate that the trajectory of continuous rehabilitation represents a dominant strategy in that it reduces costs and improves outcomes after sTBI under reasonable assumptions."
19,Temporal trends of perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids and their sulfonamide-based precursors in herring from the Swedish west coast 1991-2011 including isomer-specific considerations.,24468635,Environment international. Volume: 65 Apr 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24468635/,"A method was developed for simultaneous analysis of perfluoroalkane sulfonic acids (PFSAs) and their sulfonamide-based precursors (perfluoroalkane sulfonamidoacetic acids (FASAAs), sulfonamides (FASAs), and sulfonamidoethanols (FASEs)) in fish muscle. Extraction was performed with acetonitrile followed by a clean-up and fractionation step and instrumental analysis by UPLC/MS/MS and GC/MS. Time trends of PFSAs and their precursors in herring muscle samples originating from the Kattegat at the west coast of Sweden were investigated covering the years 1991-2011. The following analytes were detected, all with decreasing or unchanged trends between 1991 and 2011: Perfluorobutane sulfonic acid (PFBS, below the method detection limit (<MDL)-10pg/g), perfluorohexane sulfonic acid (PFHxS, 9-38pg/g), perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS, 240-930pg/g), perfluorodecane sulfonic acid (PFDS, <MDL-4pg/g), N-methyl and N-ethyl perfluorooctane sulfonamidoacetic acid (MeFOSAA and EtFOSAA, 2-39 and 2-31pg/g, respectively) and perfluorooctane sulfonamide (FOSA, 78-920pg/g). The highest concentrations were found for PFOS and FOSA around the turn of the century. Shorter disappearance half-lives were observed for precursors compared to PFSAs. Assuming that these trend differences are representative for fish consumed by the general Swedish population, this observation suggests that the relative contribution of precursors to total human exposure to PFOS via fish intake has decreased in Sweden over the study period. PFOS precursors in fish may have constituted a significant indirect exposure pathway for PFOS in the 1990s. Isomer-specific analysis of PFOS and FOSA revealed <10% relative contributions of branched isomers to total PFOS and total FOSA. Furthermore, the percentage branched isomers decreased over time for both compounds. These findings are contrary to patterns and temporal trends of PFOS isomers commonly found in human serum. In combination with literature data on isomer patterns in other edible fish species and on isomer-specific human toxicokinetics, our results suggest that fish consumption alone cannot account for the PFOS isomer patterns and trends observed in humans.

20,Sunscreen Use and Subsequent Melanoma Risk: A Population-Based Cohort Study.,27621396,Journal of clinical oncology : official journal of the American Society of Clinical Oncology. Volume: 34 Issue: 33 11 20 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27621396/,"Purpose To assess melanoma risk in relation to sunscreen use and to compare high- with low-sun protection factor (SPF) sunscreens in relation to sunbathing habits in a large cohort study. Materials and Methods We used data from the Norwegian Women and Cancer Study, a prospective population-based study of 143,844 women age 40 to 75 years at inclusion with 1,532,247 person-years of follow-up and 722 cases of melanoma. Multivariable Cox proportional hazards regression was used to estimate the association between sunscreen use (never, SPF < 15, SPF ≥ 15) and melanoma risk by calculating hazard ratios and 95% CIs. The population attributable fraction associated with sunscreen use was estimated. Results Sunscreen users reported significantly more sunburns and sunbathing vacations and were more likely to use indoor tanning devices. SPF ≥ 15 sunscreen use was associated with significantly decreased melanoma risk compared with SPF < 15 use (hazard ratio, 0.67; 95% CI, 0.53 to 0.83). The estimated decrease in melanoma (population attributable fraction) with general use of SPF ≥ 15 sunscreens by women age 40 to 75 years was 18% (95% CI, 4% to 30%). Conclusion Use of SPF ≥ 15 rather than SPF < 15 sunscreens reduces melanoma risk. Moreover, use of SPF ≥ 15 sunscreen by all women age 40 to 75 years could potentially reduce their melanoma incidence by 18%."

Volume: 196 Issue: 6 Mar 15 2016",2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26895834/,"Celiac disease (CD) is an HLA-associated disorder characterized by a harmful T cell response to dietary gluten. It is not understood why most individuals who carry CD-associated HLA molecules, such as HLA-DQ2.5, do not develop CD despite continuous gluten exposure. In this study, we have used tetramers of HLA-DQ2.5 bound with immunodominant gluten epitopes to explore whether HLA-DQ2.5(+) healthy individuals mount a specific CD4(+) T cell response to gluten. We found that gluten tetramer-binding memory cells were rare in blood of healthy individuals. These cells showed lower tetramer-binding intensity and no signs of biased TCR usage compared with gluten tetramer-binding memory T cells from patients. After sorting and in vitro expansion, only 18% of the tetramer-binding memory cells from healthy subjects versus 79% in CD patients were gluten-reactive upon tetramer restaining. Further, T cell clones of tetramer-sorted memory cells of healthy individuals showed lower gluten-specific proliferative responses compared with those of CD patients, indicating that tetramer-binding memory cells in healthy control subjects may be cross-reactive T cells. In duodenal biopsy specimens of healthy control subjects, CD4(+) T cells were determined not to be gluten reactive. Finally, gluten tetramer-binding cells of healthy individuals did not coexpress regulatory T cell markers (Foxp3(+) CD25(+)) and cultured T cell clones did not express a cytokine profile that indicated immune-dampening properties. The results demonstrate that healthy HLA-DQ2.5(+) individuals do not mount a T cell response to immunodominant gluten epitopes of CD. "

Volume: 9 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30618889/,"Background: Chronic Fatigue Syndrome/Myalgic Encephalopathy (CFS/ME) is an incapacitating illness in which single treatment interventions seem to have variable effects. Based on an earlier study we have conducted a new study with a concentrated intervention program. The aims of this study were to: (1) explore the clinical course for patients with CFS/ME who participated in a treatment program delivered during four consecutive days, and (2) evaluate their satisfaction with this program. Methods: 305 patients diagnosed with CFS/ME (Oxford criteria), recruited from a clinical population referred to a specialist outpatient clinic, participated in an open uncontrolled study of the clinical course through 1 year. The study group participated in a 4-day group intervention program, comprised by education, cognitive group therapy sessions, mindfulness sessions, physical activity and writing sessions, within a context of cognitive behavioral therapy, mindfulness, acceptance and commitment model. Assessments were done by self-reports prior to the first consultation, 1 week before and 1 week after the intervention program, and at 3 months and 1 year after the intervention. SPSS 23 and R 3.3 were used for statistical analyses. The associations between case definitions and the outcome measures (Chalder Fatigue Scale (FS), Short Form 36 (SF-36) physical functioning scale) were assessed by a linear mixed effects model (LME). Results: Results showed statistically significant clinical changes for 80% of the patients after the intervention, changes being sustained through 1 year after the program. For both Fatigue Scale (FS) and the SF-36 there were statistically significant effects of time from baseline to all time points with a statistically significant drop in scores, applying the linear mixed effects model. A subgroup fulfilling the inclusion criteria from the PACE study (Chalder Fatigue Scale >6/11, SF-36 Physical functioning <65/100) showed clinically significant improvement through 1 year, changes in outcome measures were statistically significant (p < 0.001). None of the patients included in the program dropped out, and a great majority of patients expressed high satisfaction with the content, focus and amount of treatment. Conclusion: Clinical changes observed from pre-treatment to 1 year follow-up could represent effects of the 4-day concentrated intervention program, and should be further explored in a controlled study."

In this paper, the synthesis and self-assembly behavior of supramolecular prodrug complexes (SPCs) with β-cyclodextrin-acylhydrazone-doxorubicin (β-CD-hydrazone-DOX) and the targeting of azobenzene-terminated poly[2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate] (Azo-PDMA-FA) as a building block were investigated. The obtained SPCs could also form self-assemblies on the basis of their amphiphilic nature. Next, SPC-based multi-compartment vesicles and complex micelles, which were confirmed by transmission electron microscopy and dynamic/static light scattering, were obtained with good reversibility under alternative visible light or UV irradiation. Furthermore, three-stage programmed drug-delivery behavior was observed from dual-responsive SPC-based self-assemblies by utilizing UV and pH stimuli. Specifically, the SPCs first self-assembled into multicompartmental vesicles, which was accompanied by a slow release of DOX. Next, UV-light irradiation induced the dissociation of β-CD/Azo, which led to morphology transition and a slight increase in the rate of release of DOX. Upon transferring the self-assemblies to phosphate-buffer solution (pH 5.0), the release rates increased notably as a result of the broken acylhydrazone bond. Finally, basic cell experiments further demonstrated that the SPC-based self-assemblies could be internalized into cancer cells, which suggests their promise for applications in cancer therapy."

Volume: 287 Issue: 2 Jul 15 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15925634/,"A method for the determination of water-advancing wetting angles has been developed and tested. The method allows measurements in black oils, as opposed to traditional techniques which substitute transparent model oils prior to measurements. The method is based on the Laplace equation and axisymmetric drop shape analysis. The main source of error is the determination of the drop volume. Results in transparent systems are comparable to results using other techniques. Wetting angles are determined for water in two different crude oil systems, using quartz as the substrate. The quartz surfaces are water wet over large pH ranges, but it is possible to accurately identify pH intervals where the surfaces are intermediate or oil wet."

Phenotypes of corresponding knockouts were observed, and particularly revealed delayed flowering for the B'eta knockout. The B' subunits were linked to fluorescent tags and transiently expressed in various tissues of onion, tobacco and Arabidopsis. B'eta and B'gamma targeted the cytosol and nucleus. B'zeta localized to the cytoplasm and partly co-localized with mitochondrial markers when the N-terminus was free. Provided its C-terminus was free, the B'theta subunit targeted peroxisomes. The importance of the C-terminal end for peroxisomal targeting was further confirmed by truncation of the C-terminus. The results revealed that the closely related B' subunits are targeting different organelles in plants, and exemplify the usage of the peptide serine-serine-leucine as a PTS1 peroxisomal signaling peptide."

Volume: 114 Nov 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25113187/,"An assessment in China of the application of a transportable indirect thermal dryer unit for the remediation of soils contaminated with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) demonstrated that it is well suited to remove PCBs from soils. A remarkable reduction of total PCBs in soils from 163-770 μg g(-1) to 0.08-0.15 μg g(-1) was achieved. This represented removal efficiencies of greater than 99.9% and an approximate 100% removal of the toxic equivalent of the PCBs. Furthermore, the emissions to the atmosphere from the unit were in compliance with current PCBs regulations. In conclusion, remediation of PCBs-contaminated soils based on a transportable indirect thermal dryer unit appears to be a highly efficient and environmentally sound treatment technology that has huge implications for cleaning thousands of regionally dispersed sites of PCBs contamination in China."

Volume: 265 Issue: 14 May 15 1990,1990,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2335512/,"Formation of bile acids from sitosterol in bile-fistulated female Wistar rats was studied with use of 4-14C-labeled sitosterol and sitosterol labeled with 3H in specific positions. The major part (about 75%) of the 14C radioactivity recovered as bile acids in bile after intravenous administration of [4-14C]sitosterol was found to be considerably more polar than cholic acid, and only trace amounts of radioactivity had chromatographic properties similar to those of cholic acid and chenodeoxycholic acid. It was shown that polar metabolites were formed by intermediate oxidation of the 3 beta-hydroxyl group (loss of 3H from 3 alpha-3H-labeled sitosterol) and that the most polar fraction did not contain a hydroxyl group at C7 (retention of 3H in 7 alpha,7 beta-3H2-labeled sitosterol). Furthermore, the polar metabolites had lost at least the terminal 6 or 7 carbon atoms of the side chain (loss of 3H from 22,23-3H2- and 24,28-3H2-labeled sitosterol). Experiments with 3H-labeled 7 alpha-hydroxysitosterol and 4-14C-labeled 26-hydroxysitosterol showed that none of these compounds was an efficient precursor to the polar metabolites. By analysis of purified most polar products of [4-14C] sitosterol by radio-gas chromatography and the same products of 7 alpha,7 beta-[2H2]sitosterol by combined gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, two major metabolites could be identified as C21 bile acids. One metabolite had three hydroxyl groups (3 alpha, 15, and unknown), and one had two hydroxyl groups (3 alpha, 15) and one keto group. Considerably less C21 bile acids were formed from [4-14C]sitosterol in male than in female Wistar rats. The C21 bile acids formed in male rats did not contain a 15-hydroxyl group. Conversion of a [4-14C]sitosterol into C21 bile acids did also occur in adrenalectomized and ovariectomized rats, indicating that endocrine tissues are not involved. Experiments with isolated perfused liver gave direct evidence that the overall conversion of sitosterol into C21 bile acids occurs in this organ. Intravenously injected 7 alpha,7 beta-3H-labeled campesterol gave a product pattern identical to that of 4-14C-labeled sitosterol. Possible mechanisms for hepatic conversion of sitosterol and campesterol into C21 bile acids are discussed."

Two main themes with subthemes were found: Confirming: attending to patients' basic needs; seeing patient; having time for patient; being with patient; listening to patient without prejudice; being open to patient; accepting patient's feelings; communicating hope to patient; and Lack of confirming: overlooking patient's basic needs; not seeing patient; not having time for patient; leaving patient to herself or himself; listening to patient with prejudice; not being open to patient; denying patient her or his feelings; communicating hopelessness to patient. These findings were interpreted in the light of Hegel's philosophy of mutual recognition and confirmation. When relating episodes of good or bad nursing care suicidal patients emphasized their need for confirmation during their interaction with nurses when in hospital after suicide attempts."

This ring structure has a molecular mass of 1.2 kDa, and is chemically closely related to the potassium ionophore valinomycin. Two of the three enterotoxins have been shown to be involved in food poisoning. They both consist of three different proteins that act together. One of these enterotoxins is also a haemolysin. This haemolytic enterotoxin is transcribed from one operon. The third enterotoxin is a single component protein, but has not been shown to be involved in food poisoning."

Gene expression profiling studies on limited numbers of specimens have shown high expression of IGF2, encoding the activating ligand for this system, in gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs) and in synovial sarcomas. This data may have concrete clinical implications, as several reports exist of patients with GISTs suffering from severe hypoglycemia, a predicted effect of IGF2. Furthermore, new drugs targeting IGF signaling are entering clinical trials. The purpose of this study is to survey IGF2 expression at the protein level on a broad number of mesenchymal tumors representing all major diagnostic classes. By immunostaining tissue microarrays, results were obtained for 51 diagnostic categories of bone and soft-tissue tumors representing 1288 cases. Distinct membranous and/or cytoplasmic IGF2 immunoreactivity was assessed according to published criteria. Solitary fibrous tumors had the highest expression. Of 20 tumor types represented by more than 10 cases, synovial sarcomas, myxoid liposarcomas, GISTs, malignant peripheral nerve sheath tumors, chondrosarcomas, undifferentiated pleomorphic sarcomas (MFH), Ewing's sarcomas and tenosynovial giant cell tumors showed high levels of expression in more than 20% of cases. Of the 445 GIST cases with clinical information, those with high expression of IGF2 had a significantly worse outcome than those with low or no expression. IGF2 protein expression among mesenchymal tumors is largely consistent with gene expression studies and suggests a potential for molecular therapy targeting the IGF signaling pathway system in these neoplasms."

Simulations of realistic flow in a carotid artery bifurcation were used to assess the accuracy of the vector Doppler (VD) technique. Reduction in root mean square deviation from 27 cm/s to 6 cm/s and 7 cm/s to 2 cm/s was found for the lateral (vx) and axial (vz) velocity components, respectively, when the ensemble size was increased from 8 to 50. Simulations of a Couette flow phantom (vmax = 2.7 cm/s) gave promising results for imaging of slowly moving tissue, with root mean square deviation of 4.4 mm/s and 1.6 mm/s for the x- and z-components, respectively. A packet acquisition scheme providing both B-mode and vector Doppler RF data was implemented on a research scanner, and beamforming and further post-processing was done offline. In vivo results of healthy volunteers were in accordance with simulations and gave promising results for flow and tissue vector velocity imaging. The technique was also tested in patients with carotid artery disease. Using the high ensemble vector Doppler technique, blood flow through stenoses and secondary flow patterns were better visualized than in ordinary color Doppler. Additionally, the full velocity spectrum could be obtained retrospectively for arbitrary points in the image."
40,Gene activation studied by immunological methods.,7889849,Environmental health perspectives. Volume: 102 Suppl 6 Oct 1994,1994,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7889849/,"Gene activation can be studied at several levels: transcription (mRNA), translation (proteins), or phenotypical alterations (functional activity or morphology). These levels can be studied in situ or biochemically by the use of specific probes for normal or altered DNA, mRNA, or proteins. Immunological probes are potent tools for studies of alterations induced by xenobiotics in target organs. When the effects of xenobiotics are studied in whole tissue, the cellular heterogeneity of the organ must be taken into account. For this reason, combined in situ and biochemical techniques are necessary. Antibodies to normal or altered cellular constituents are used for identification, quantitation, and cellular localization of proteins and modified DNA. Many xenobiotics alter gene activation by interactions with DNA. After activation, 2-acetylaminofluorene (AAF) forms DNA adducts, which can be identified immunologically. Combined with bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) pulse labeling, techniques have been developed to demonstrate reduced adduct concentrations in proliferating cells and preneoplastic foci in the livers of AAF-fed rats. Carcinogen-induced DNA modifications are implicated as a major mechanism of altered gene activation in neoplasia, leading to phenotypical alterations. Also, cellular differentiation may be affected by xenobiotics. Differentiation-associated markers can be used for studies of gene activation. In mouse skin, the keratins K1 and K10 are only expressed in suprabasal, differentiating cells. BrdU pulse chase experiments combined with double immunofluorescence have revealed that K1 and K10 are sequentially turned on 18 to 24 hr after DNA synthesis and are followed by suprabasal migration. After a single application of the tumor promotor 12-O-tetradecanoylphorbol-13-acetate (TPA), cell migration starts directly after mitosis.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

The primary objective was to study to what extent major cations and possibility anions in the precipitation might affect the uptake by competition or possibly by complexing reactions. In addition the effect on metal uptake of pH and temperature was studied. The uptake of Zn and partly Cu was lower from precipitation with a high content of seasalt. With increasing metal concentration an increasing amount of Zn and Cu accumulated in the moss. These observations suggest that cations in the precipitation such as Na(+) and Mg(2+) may affect the uptake by competition. Possibly also Cl(-) may interfere by complexing reactions. Uptake of Zn and Cd was pH dependent. The uptake of all four metals increased with temperature. The results from this work appear to be significant with respect to the interpreation of data from atmospheric deposition surveys based on moss analysis. "

Using nonequilibrium molecular dynamics simulations, we show that the thermal polarization features a significant dependence with temperature that ultimately leads to an inversion phenomenon, whereby the polarization field reverses its sign at a specific temperature. Temperature inversion effects have been reported before in the Soret coefficient of aqueous solutions, where the solution changes from thermophobic to thermophilic at specific temperatures. We show that a similar inversion behavior is observed in pure water. Microscopically, the inversion is the result of a balance of dipolar and quadrupolar contributions and the strong temperature dependence of the quadrupolar contribution, which is determined by the thermal expansion of the liquid.

Volume: 66 Issue: 14 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17040112/,"In the past 10 years, progress has been made in the management of patients with chronic hepatitis C. A sustained virological response (SVR) is achieved in 80-85% of patients infected with hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype 2 or 3 after 24 weeks of treatment with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin. Treatment durations <24 weeks have been investigated to determine whether shorter-term therapy reduces adverse effects and costs compared with longer-term therapy without compromising efficacy. Three studies involving only patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3, with different baseline patient characteristics have shown that 12-16 weeks of treatment can be as effective as 24 weeks of treatment. In all three trials, undetectable HCV RNA 4 weeks after the start of treatment was defined as rapid virological response (RVR), and only patients with RVR stopped treatment early. In the first trial, 75% of patients treated with peginterferon-alpha-2b and ribavirin achieved RVR; these rapid responders achieved an SVR rate of 90% after 14 weeks of treatment. In the second trial, 63% of patients achieved RVR after 4 weeks of treatment with peginterferon-alpha-2b and ribavirin, and 85% of patients with RVR achieved SVR after 12 weeks of treatment. In comparison, 91% of patients with RVR treated for 24 weeks had SVR. In the third study, 93% of the total study population achieved RVR and were randomly assigned to 16 or 24 weeks of treatment with peginterferon-alpha-2a and ribavirin. Among patients with RVR, 85% in the group treated for 16 weeks and 80% in the group treated for 24 weeks achieved SVR. Among patients with HCV genotype 2 or 3, achieving an RVR to interferon-based treatment is common and a criterion to reduce the duration of treatment. In patients with genotype 2 and RVR, 12 weeks of therapy with peginterferon-alpha and ribavirin is recommended. For patients with genotype 3, a univocal recommendation on treatment duration cannot be made. However, ongoing trials will probably clarify this aspect."

The scientific basis for the taxonomy of dairy relevant leuconostocs can be traced back 50 years, and no documentation on the genomic diversity of leuconostocs in starter cultures exists. We present data on the Leuconostoc population in five DL-type starter cultures commonly used by the dairy industry. The analyses were performed using traditional cultivation methods, and further augmented by next-generation DNA sequencing methods. Bacterial counts for starter cultures cultivated on two different media, MRS and MPCA, revealed large differences in the relative abundance of leuconostocs. Most of the leuconostocs in two of the starter cultures were unable to grow on MRS, emphasizing the limitations of culture-based methods and the importance of careful media selection or use of culture independent methods. Pan-genomic analysis of 59 Leuconostoc genomes enabled differentiation into twelve robust lineages. The genomic analyses show that the dairy-associated leuconostocs are highly adapted to their environment, characterized by the acquisition of genotype traits, such as the ability to metabolize citrate. In particular, Leuconostoc mesenteroides subsp. cremoris display telltale signs of a degenerative evolution, likely resulting from a long period of growth in milk in association with lactococci. Great differences in the metabolic potential between Leuconostoc species and subspecies were revealed. Using targeted amplicon sequencing, the composition of the Leuconostoc population in the five commercial starter cultures was shown to be significantly different. Three of the cultures were dominated by Ln. mesenteroides subspecies cremoris. Leuconostoc pseudomesenteroides dominated in two of the cultures while Leuconostoc lactis, reported to be a major constituent in fermented dairy products, was only present in low amounts in one of the cultures. This is the first in-depth study of Leuconostoc genomics and diversity in dairy starter cultures. The results and the techniques presented may be of great value for the dairy industry."

Volume: 29 Issue: 4 May 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23039016/,"Rehabilitating walking in ambulatory patients post-stroke, with training that is safe, task-specific, intensive, and of sufficient duration, can be challenging. Some challenges can be met by using body-weight-supported treadmill training (BWSTT). However, it is not known to what degree walking characteristics are similar during BWSTT and overground walking. In addition, important questions regarding the training protocol of BWSTT remain unanswered, such as how proportion of body-weight support (BWS) and walking speed affect walking characteristics during training. The objective was therefore to investigate if and how kinematic walking characteristics are different between overground walking and treadmill walking with BWS in ambulatory patients post-stroke, and the acute response of altering walking speed and percent BWS during treadmill walking with BWS. A cross-sectional repeated-measures design was used. Ambulating patients post-stroke walked in slow, preferred, and fast walking speed overground and at comparable speeds on the treadmill with 20% and 40% BWS. Kinematic walking characteristics were obtained using a kinematic sensor attached over the lower back. Forty-four patients completed the protocol. Kinematic walking characteristics were similar during treadmill walking with BWS, compared to walking overground. During treadmill walking, choice of walking speed had greater impact on kinematic walking characteristics than proportion of BWS. Faster walking speeds tended to affect the kinematic walking characteristics positively. This implies that in order to train safely and with sufficient intensity and duration, therapists may choose to include BWSTT in walking rehabilitation also for ambulatory patients post-stroke without aggravating gait pattern during training."

The case-fatality has remained high, at about 10%. In this study, an outer membrane vaccine, which had previously been shown to induce an increase in bactericidal antibodies to the parent strain, was assessed in a large-scale, randomised, double-blind trial. From October, 1988, 171,800 students in secondary schools volunteered to take part in a double-blind, placebo-controlled, efficacy trial with school as the randomisation unit. Hospitals and clinics that routinely receive patients with infectious disease were asked to report urgently all cases of suspected meningitis and/or septicaemia in 13-21-year-old students in Norway. These cases were registered and further investigated according to a detailed protocol. 89 out of the 221 cases investigated by June 3, 1991, were shown to be severe systemic disease due to group B meningococci. 36 cases in 35 schools took part in the trial (11 schools with vaccinated students and 24 with students given placebo). The calculated rate of protection was thus 57.2% (p = 0.012, one-sided test). The findings suggest that, although the vaccine conferred protection against group B meningococcal disease, the effect was insufficient to justify a public vaccination programme."

Sumatriptan could putatively exert a therapeutic effect in this vascular bed. The present study is an attempt to assess sumatriptan's vasoactivity in isolated porcine ophthalmic artery (POA) and to verify whether it has similar activity to 5HT, and whether it interferes with the vasodilation induced by calcitonin gene-related peptide (CGRP) and vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP). In contrast to 5HT, sumatriptan induced only slight contraction in POA at high concentrations. However, in some artery segments pre-contracted with PGF2 alpha, sumatriptan induced a slight and short-lasting but marked relaxation. In addition, relaxations induced by VIP were inhibited significantly by sumatriptan, whereas CGRP effects were not influenced by the drug. Such reactions suggest that sumatriptan's effect in CH is probably unrelated to direct ocular arterial vasoconstriction."

Volume: 8 Issue: 9 Sep 1993",1993,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8253928/,"Two-colour immunofluorescence was used to study components of the secretory immune system in the endometrium. Tissue sampling was performed in the follicular, ovulatory and luteal menstrual phase from women admitted for laparoscopic sterilization. The specimens were prepared for immunohistochemistry by a method that removes most extracellular immunoglobulin (Ig). The stroma contained only a few Ig-producing immunocytes, but was rich in HLA-DR positive cells. Most of the IgA- and IgM-producing immunocytes also expressed J chain, which is necessary for the generation of polymeric Ig (poly-Ig) with affinity for epithelial secretory component (SC or poly-Ig receptor). Throughout the menstrual cycle there was increasing accumulation of Ig within the endometrial glands, with preferential apical and intraluminal occurrence of IgA and IgM, usually along with J chain and SC. It is likely that some monomeric IgA (without J chain) and IgG enter the endometrial glands by passive diffusion from the stroma, but there is clearly an additional active external poly-Ig transport. Some of the glands stained for HLA-DR irrespective of the menstrual phase or degree of SC expression. Our findings suggest that active SC-mediated external transport of serum-derived (and to some extent locally produced) poly-Ig is enhanced in the luteal phase, and that SC and HLA class II molecules are differently regulated in the endometrial glands."

Volume: 15 Issue: 2 Feb 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15647831/,"The availability of several complete genome sequences and large numbers of expressed sequences, has led to the development of bioinformatic strategies for large-scale predictions of natural antisense transcripts. In the past two years, this has given at least 1,600 human pairs and 2,500 murine pairs of natural antisense transcripts. However, due to limitations in bioinformatic search tools, experimental validation of the predicted antisense transcripts is crucial. This has been performed only for a small fraction of the large number of predicted natural antisense transcripts. Additionally, bioinformatic approaches will not allow systematic identification of natural antisense transcripts in specific cell or tissue types. More recently, an experimental approach for identification of sense-antisense transcript pairs has been developed. The principle of the strategy is based upon the selection of double-stranded cDNAs as a result of hybridization between first-strand cDNAs that should be generated in the presence of actinomycin D. This experimental strategy allows systematic analysis of sense and antisense partners in any cell or tissue type."

The key elements of these vectors are a regulatable promoter involved in the production of the bacteriocins sakacin A and sakacin P and the genes encoding the cognate histidine protein kinase and response regulator that are necessary to activate this promoter upon induction by a peptide pheromone. The vectors are built up of cassettes that permit easy exchange of all parts through restriction enzyme digestion and ligation. Using beta-glucuronidase as a reporter enzyme, variants of these vectors were compared with each other, and with a corresponding system based on genes involved in the production of nisin. Several of the new vectors permitted tightly controlled and efficient expression of beta-glucuronidase in both L. sakei and L. plantarum."

Volume: 38 Issue: 4 Sep 1997,1997,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9347148/,"1. An experiment was carried out to determine the effect of soaking at 0 degrees C, soaking at room temperature, germination, or enzyme treatment of whole barley on feeding value and digestive tract parameters of 2- to 4-week old broiler chickens given diets with 700g/kg whole barley. 2. Soaking or germination decreased the soluble and total beta-glucan content (P < 0.05) and, except for soaking at 0 degrees C, the acid extract viscosity of the grain also decreased (P < 0.05). Germination and soaking in the presence of enzymes produced the lowest beta-glucan content and viscosity. 3. Except for soaking in cold water, the soaking, germination and enzyme treatments increased weight gain and decreased food:gain ratio (P < 0.05). Correspondingly, the digestibility of protein, fat, and ash, and the digestible energy content, increased (P < 0.05) after enzyme treatment or germination. 4. Chickens fed on enzyme-treated or germinated barley diets had intestinal contents with a greater proportion of dry matter and lower viscosity than chickens fed on untreated barley (P < 0.05). Consequently, the cages and chickens were cleaner (P < 0.05) and the weight of digestive organs as proportion of live weight was lower. 5. Particle size analysis of excreta revealed that whole barley was efficiently ground by the gizzards of 16-d-old chickens, and very few whole kernels were found."

Volume: 207 Issue: 1 May 25 1991,1991,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1833213/,"A number of commonly used calcium channel blockers have been compared with respect to their effects on the bioenergetics of catecholamine storage vesicles. Chromaffin granule ghosts with a well-preserved ability to actively transport and store catecholamines, were used as a model for adrenergic synaptic vesicles due to their functional similarity. Nicardipine, verapamil, terodiline and diltiazem were found to have effects comparable to that of prenylamine (Grønberg, M., O. Terland, E.S. Husebye and T. Flatmark, 1990. Biochem. Pharmacol. 40, 351) by inhibiting the generation of a transmembrane proton electrochemical gradient driven by the vesicular H(+)-ATPase, mainly by loose-coupling/uncoupling of this ATPase. Amlodipine inhibited the internal acidification of the vesicles in a tyramine-like manner and increased the steady-state membrane potential (positive inside) generated by the MgATP-dependent proton translocation. Nifedipine and felodipine also inhibited the efficiency of the proton pump, but their mechanisms of action require further investigation. The concentrations giving 50% inhibition of the H(+)-ATPase-dependent generation of a pH-gradient were found to be: 12 microM felodipine, 16 microM nicardipine, 25 microM terodiline, 50 microM nifedipine, 60 microM verapamil, 65 microM amlodipine and 150 microM diltiazem. The effects of the calcium channel blockers on the bioenergetics of chromaffin granules explain the release of catecholamines from sympathetic nerves and ganglia in vitro by the calcium channel blockers."

Secretion of soluble cytokine receptors has been suggested as a mechanism of regulating cytokine activity in vivo. In a previous study we detected soluble TNF receptors (TNFRs) in amniotic fluid and urine samples from pregnant women, suggesting that secretion of soluble TNFRs may provide a mechanism for protection of the fetus against TNF action during pregnancy. In the present study, TNFR containing cells in cryostat sections from normal placentas at term were evaluated by monoclonal antibodies against the 55 kD--and the 75 kD TNFR in an indirect immunofluorescence technique. The 55 kD TNFR was expressed by the villous syncytiotrophoblasts, by vascular endothelial cells, by some decidual cells and by occasional cells in the placental stroma. Staining for the 75 kD TNFR was confined to the vascular endothelial cells, a relatively small number of stromal cells and decidual cells, whereas the villous syncytiotrophoblasts were negative. The abundant expression of TNFRs in placental tissue suggests: 1. That a considerable number of the placental cells are receptive to the regulatory activities of TNF; 2. That placental cells may be the cellular origin of soluble TNFRs secreted during pregnancy."

Although association between the amount of dietary fat intake, lipemic response and certain cardiovascular disease (CVD) risk factors (VIIa and PAI-1) has been reported, the significance of the fatty acid composition of ingested fat for the postprandial lipid concentrations and the hemostatic factors is still unclear. Accumulating evidence suggests a relationship between dietary fatty acids and emerging hemostatic CVD risk factors, although much of this evidence is incomplete or conflicting. In order to improve our knowledge in this area, sufficient sample size in future studies are required to take into account of the genetic variation (gene polymorphisms for VII, PAI-1), sex, physical activity, stage of life factors, and sufficient duration to account for adaptation for definitive conclusions."

Volume: 30 Issue: 2 Feb 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25155887/,"Inhibition of sclerostin, a glycoprotein secreted by osteocytes, offers a new therapeutic paradigm for treatment of osteoporosis (OP) through its critical role as Wnt/catenin signaling regulator. This study describes the epigenetic regulation of SOST expression in bone biopsies of postmenopausal women. We correlated serum sclerostin to bone mineral density (BMD), fractures, and bone remodeling parameters, and related these findings to epigenetic and genetic disease mechanisms. Serum sclerostin and bone remodeling biomarkers were measured in two postmenopausal groups: healthy (BMD T-score > -1) and established OP (BMD T-score < -2.5, with at least one low-energy fracture). Bone specimens were used to analyze SOST mRNAs, single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs), and DNA methylation changes. The SOST gene promoter region showed increased CpG methylation in OP patients (n = 4) compared to age and body mass index (BMI) balanced controls (n = 4) (80.5% versus 63.2%, p = 0.0001) with replication in independent cohorts (n = 27 and n = 36, respectively). Serum sclerostin and bone SOST mRNA expression correlated positively with age-adjusted and BMI-adjusted total hip BMD (r = 0.47 and r = 0.43, respectively; both p < 0.0005), and inversely to serum bone turnover markers. Five SNPs, one of which replicates in an independent population-based genomewide association study (GWAS), showed association with serum sclerostin or SOST mRNA levels under an additive model (p = 0.0016 to 0.0079). Genetic and epigenetic changes in SOST influence its bone mRNA expression and serum sclerostin levels in postmenopausal women. The observations suggest that increased SOST promoter methylation seen in OP is a compensatory counteracting mechanism, which lowers serum sclerostin concentrations and reduces inhibition of Wnt signaling in an attempt to promote bone formation."

Volume: 6 Issue: 12 Dec 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18046481/,"Generation of the reactive oxygen species (ROS) in skin by exposure to ultraviolet (UV) radiation induces a number of cutaneous pathologies such as skin cancer, photosensitization, and photoaging among others. Skin iron catalyzes UV generation of ROS. Topical application of iron chelators reduces erythema, epidermal and dermal hypertrophy, wrinkle formation, tumour appearance. It has been proposed that iron chelators can be useful agents against damaging effects of both short- and long-term UV exposure. A better understanding of the action mechanisms of iron chelators, might be useful to developing effective anticancer and antiphotoaging cosmetic products. Iron chelators may lead to accumulation of protoporphyrin IX (PpIX), a strong photosensitizer. The action of iron chelators in skin, related to PpIX increase has not yet been thoroughly studied. Therefore, we have investigated the formation of PpIX in normal mouse skin after topical application of creams containing metal chelators. The amount and distribution of porphyrins formed was determined by means of non-invasive fluorescence spectroscopy. Deferoxamine (DF), ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA), 1,2-diethyl-3-hydroxypyridin-4-one (CP94), but not meso-2,3-dimercaptosuccinic acid (DMSA), caused increased accumulation of endogenous porphyrins in the skin. Fluorescence excitation and emission spectroscopy confirmed that PpIX was the main fluorescent species. The amount of PpIX accumulated in skin under the present conditions was not large enough to produce any significant erythema after light exposure. Further studies are needed to evaluate the role of PpIX induced by iron chelators used, against photoaging and cancer prevention."

The 5-year survival rate has remained below 50% over the last two decades, and new tools for early diagnosis are needed. Saliva has been used for diagnosis of several systemic diseases, and its use for diagnosis of OSCC has been sought extensively. Among the many salivary analytes for diagnosis of OSCC, accumulating evidences indicate the possibility of using salivary cytokines. Overproduction of proinflammatory, proangiogenic cytokines by OSCC cells has been reported, and their role in tumor progression and angiogenesis is well established. However, many inflammatory conditions and immunological diseases could affect the levels of cytokines in serum and saliva. This article has reviewed publications in this matter, and some strengths and weaknesses have been pointed out. Conclusively, large-scale investigations are required for validation of the use of salivary cytokines for diagnosis of OSCC, with consideration to the influential role of periodontal inflammation in their levels."

Volume: 114 Issue: 2 Jan 30 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27863882/,"The main goal of this study was to determine the concentrations of trace elements in the mineralogically contrasting shells of two Arctic bivalves: Chlamys islandica and Ciliatocardium ciliatum. Aragonite shells seem to be more susceptible to the binding of metal ions, which is most likely a result of their crystal lattice structure. We suggest that less biologically controlled aragonite mineralization tends to incorporate more metal impurities into the crystal lattice in waters with a lower pH, where metal ions are more available. Higher concentrations of impurities may further increase the lattice distortion causing lower crystal lattice stability and higher susceptibility to dissolution. Calcitic shells seem to be less prone to bind metal ions than aragonite shells most likely because under strict biological control, the uptake of ions from ambient seawater is more selective; thus, the final crystal lattice is less contaminated by other metals and is more resistant to dissolution."

Males on an average consumed more coffee (5.1 +/- 3.3 cups/day) than females (4.4 +/- 3.1 cups/day). Neither in those with a high consumption of coffee: > or =10 cups a day (n = 134), nor in those with a considerable variation in consumption: > or =10 cups/day (n = 31) did there seem to be a definite increase in headache resembling caffeine-withdrawal headache, for instance during weekends. In seven parishioners, however, there did seem to be such a headache, and in two of them, the evidence was rather convincing. This headache generally seemed to be mild and global and occurred mainly in the morning hours on weekends. There was no nausea, no throbbing quality of the pain, and no reported use of analgesics. Coffee seemed to abate the headache. This frequency (0.4%) should, clearly, be regarded as a minimum figure.

Thus, it is important to quantify and predict the formation of these products under different conditions in indoor environments. We developed the kinetic multilayer model that explicitly resolves mass transport and chemical reactions at the skin and in the gas phase (KM-SUB-Skin). It can reproduce the concentrations of ozone and organic compounds in previous measurements and new experiments. This enabled the spatial and temporal concentration profiles in the skin oil and underlying skin layers to be resolved. Upon exposure to ~30 ppb ozone, the concentrations of squalene ozonolysis products in the gas phase and in the skin reach up to several ppb and on the order of ~10 mmol m-3 . Depending on various factors including the number of people, room size, and air exchange rates, concentrations of ozone can decrease substantially due to reactions with skin lipids. Ozone and dicarbonyls quickly react away in the upper layers of the skin, preventing them from penetrating deeply into the skin and hence reaching the blood."

When applied to cell preparations, the same methods are called immunocytochemistry (Fig. 1), although some authors also use this term for immunostaining of cellular components in tissue sections. Note that compared with immunostaining of vital cells in suspension or cultured monolayers, the sensitivity of immunohistochemical cell-surface staining is considerably reduced because of the decreased amounts of marker antigen represented by the cross-section of the plasma membrane. Also, for certain cellular markers examined in a tissue section, truly peripheral staining may be difficult to distinguish from a rim of cytoplasmic antigen expression. Fig. 1. Immunohistochemistry (A) is performed on tissue sections whereas immunocytochemistry (B) is performed on cells in suspensions, smears, or monolayers. Antibodies do not penetrate the surface membrane of living cells; therefore, unequivocal peripheral staining is obtained only for cells in suspension or vital monolayers. With tissue sections or dried (and fixed) cells, it is difficult to distinguish peripheral from cytoplasmic immunostaining unless the antigen is a distinct surface membrane marker."

Volume: 8 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29326625/,"Physical inactivity, low physical fitness, and perceived stress during adolescence are presumed to be risk factors for various disorders and subjective health complaints. On the other hand, physical activity and physical fitness, as well as mindfulness qualities, are regarded as prerequisites for health and well-being in children and adolescent, possibly by moderating the negative effects of stress and protecting against stress-related health complaints. Previous studies have suggested gender differences in the relationship between physical activity/physical fitness and psychological variables. The main objective in this study was to evaluate how physical fitness, along with mindfulness qualities (MAAS-A), pain, and BMI, relate to stress (PSQ) in adolescents. Secondary objectives were to explore the relationship between physical fitness, mindfulness (MAAS-A), and BMI more explicitly in the study sample, as well as to evaluate possible gender differences. The cross-sectional sample included 102 Norwegian pupils in 10th grade (15 or 16 years). Study measurements were four items from the Test of Physical Fitness (TPF), the Norwegian version of the four-factor Perceived Stress Questionnaire (PSQ), the Norwegian version of the Mindful Attention Awareness Scale-Adolescent (MAAS-A), and BMI (recorded in terms of self-reported height and weight). Additionally, pain was measured in terms of localization, number of pain sites, duration, and intensity (Visual analogue scale; VAS). According to the regression analyses, physical fitness could not explain any variation in stress among the adolescents. Nevertheless, there were some negative associations between one stress factor (lack of joy) and components of physical fitness at a group level, possibly influenced by conditions not measured in this study. As opposed to physical fitness, mindfulness qualities, and to some degree gender, seemed to explain variation in stress among the adolescents. None of the physical fitness components were associated to mindfulness (MAAS-A), but some components seemed negatively related to BMI, particularly among the males. Among the females, higher physical fitness (in terms of endurance) seemed related to reduced number of pain sites. Of note, the cross-sectional design did not allow us to determine any causal direction among the variables."

One aim was to detect increases in birth detect prevalences that was caused by new harmful exposures. Over the years several studies of unexpected time-trends and regional differences have been performed, but specific harmful exposures have so far not been detected. In a study of possible effects of the Chernobyl fallout, the registry enabled a detailed investigation of a possible increase in prevalence of birth detects that occurred specifically in the most exposed areas of Norway. The strength of this approach was the population coverage of the registry, while important limitations were incomplete reporting (outcome misclassification) and crude exposure information (exposure misclassification). While still taking advantage of the population coverage of the medical birth registry, a new generation of studies with more complete case ascertainment and individual exposure information are being prepared. One particularly interesting new option is to use molecular genetic tools to identity susceptible mothers or children. Collection and storage of biological specimens on a large scale is challenging, but in the search for gene-environment interactions, population-based studies are particularly attractive."

Volume: 46 Issue: 1 Jan 03 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22091699/,"As the world's largest CO(2) emitter and steel producer, China has set the ambitious goal of establishing a circular economy which aims at reconciling economic development with environmental protection and sustainable resource use. This work applies dynamic material flow analysis to forecast production, recycling, and iron ore consumption in the Chinese steel cycle until 2100 by using steel services in terms of in-use stock per capita as driver of future development. The whole cycle is modeled to determine possible responses of the steel industry in light of the circular economy concept. If per-capita stock saturates at 8-12 tons as evidence from industrialized countries suggests, consumption may peak between 2015 and 2020, whereupon it is likely to drop by up to 40% until 2050. A slower growing in-use stock could mitigate this peak and hence reduce overcapacity in primary production. Old scrap supply will increase substantially and it could replace up to 80% of iron ore as resource for steel making by 2050. This would require advanced recycling technologies as manufacturers of machinery and transportation equipment would have to shift to secondary steel as well as new capacities in secondary production which could, however, make redundant already existing integrated steel plants."

Volume: 54 Issue: 5 May 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21547788/,"The long-term impact of role stress (conflict and ambiguity), cognitive rumination and their interaction were analysed upon morning and evening saliva cortisol secretion. The sample consisted of 52 male and 24 female British white-collars who had participated in a survey study on psychosocial working conditions 3.5 years earlier. Saliva cortisol secretion was measured over seven consecutive days with two measures: in the morning on awakening and at 22.00 hours. Stepwise linear multiple regression analyses was used for the statistical analyses. Role ambiguity at baseline and the interaction between role ambiguity and trait rumination contributed to explaining elevations in morning saliva cortisol secretion 3.5 years later (R(2) = 0.045; F = 4.57; p < 0.05), while role conflict at baseline significantly predicted increases in long-term evening saliva cortisol (R(2) = 0.057; F = 8.99; p < 0.01). The findings support a long-term relationship between chronic stress exposure and saliva cortisol secretion and some support for the assumption of cognitive rumination moderating the stressor-strain relationship. STATEMENT OF RElevance: The study is of interest for ergonomics practice because it demonstrates that work role ambiguity and role conflict, typically associated with organisational downsizing and restructuring, may contribute to long-term psycho-physiological reactivity. This could expose workers to increased health risks. Therefore, stress management programmes should include the concept of role stress, especially at a time where many work organisations are undergoing significant change. Management should also be made aware of the importance of communicating clear goals, objectives and lines of authority as well as providing sufficient training for those in new job roles."

Volume: 277 Issue: 6 Mar 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20148961/,"It is assumed that protein fibrils manifested in amyloidosis result from an aggregation reaction involving small misfolded protein sequences being in an 'oligomeric' or 'prefibrillar' state. This review covers recent optical spectroscopic studies of amyloid protein misfolding, oligomerization and amyloid fibril growth. Although amyloid fibrils have been studied using established protein-characterization techniques throughout the years, their oligomeric precursor states require sensitive detection in real-time. Here, fluorescent staining is commonly performed using thioflavin T and other small fluorescent molecules such as 4-(dicyanovinyl)- julolidine and 1-amino-8-naphtalene sulphonate that have high affinity to hydrophobic patches. Thus, populated oligomeric intermediates and related 'prefibrillar structures' have been reported for several human amyloidogenic systems, including amyloid-beta protein, prion protein, transthyretin, alpha-synuclein, apolipoprotein C-II and insulin. To obtain information on the progression of the intermediate states, these were monitored in terms of fluorescence parameters, such as anisotropy, and quantum efficiency changes upon protein binding. Recently, new antibody stains have allowed precise monitoring of the oligomer size and distributions using multicolor labelling and single molecule detection. Moreover, a pentameric thiophene derivative (p-FTAA) was reported to indicate early precursors during A-beta(1-40) fibrillation, and was also demonstrated in real-time visualization of cerebral protein aggregates in transgenic AD mouse models by multiphoton microscopy. Conclusively, molecular probes and optical spectroscopy are now entering a phase enabling the in vivo interrogation of the role of oligomers in amyloidosis. Such techniques used in parallel with in vitro experiments, of increasing detail, will probably couple structure to pathogenesis in the near future."

Elite junior cross-country skiers of both sexes trained 12-15 h weeks-1 for 5 months at either moderate (60-70% of VO2max, MIG) or high training intensity (80-90% of the VO2max, close to the lactate threshold; HIG). Muscle biopsies for enzyme analyses and fibre typing were taken before and after the training period. Histochemical analyses on single fibres were done for three enzymes (succinate dehydrogenase [SDH], hydroxybutyrate dehydrogenase [HBDH], glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase [GPDH]), while the activity of citrate synthase [CS] and phosphofructokinase [PFK] was measured on whole biopsies. The activity of GPDH was low in ST fibres and high in FT fibres. The activity of SDH and HBDH was high in both ST and FTa fibres but low in the FTb fibres. The HIG increased their performance more than the MIG did during the training period as judged from scores on a 20-min run test. The SDH activity rose by 6% for the HIG (P < 0.02). No effects of training were found in the activities of CS, HBDH or GPDH, neither in the two training groups nor for the two genders (P > or = 0.16). The PFK activity fell by 10% for the HIG (P=0.02), while no change was found for the MIG. For GPDH, CS and SDH the women's activity was approximately 20% less than the value for the men (P < 0.03). For PFK and HBDH there was no sex difference (P > or = 0.27). There were positive correlations between the activity of three of the enzymes (CS, SDH and GPDH) and the performance parameters (VO2max, cross-country skiing and running performance; r > or = 0.6, P < 0.01). No correlations were found between the PFK or HBDH activities and the performance parameters (r < or = 0.16, P > 0.05). This study suggests that intensities near the lactate threshold affect biochemical and physiological parameters examined in this study as well as the performance of elite skiers, and that the rate-limiting enzymes may be more sensitive to training than non-rate-limiting enzymes."

When expressed as recombinant pancreatic proteins, some mutations result in enzymes with normal/near-normal catalytic properties. The molecular mechanism(s) of GCK-MODY due to these mutations has remained elusive. Here, we aimed to explore the molecular mechanisms for two such catalytically 'normal' GCK mutations (S263P and G264S) in the F260-L270 loop of GK. When stably overexpressed in HEK293 cells and MIN6 β-cells, the S263P- and G264S-encoded mutations generated misfolded proteins with an increased rate of degradation (S263P>G264S) by the protein quality control machinery, and a propensity to self-associate (G264S>S263P) and form dimers (SDS resistant) and aggregates (partly Triton X-100 insoluble), as determined by pulse-chase experiments and subcellular fractionation. Thus, the GCK-MODY mutations S263P and G264S lead to protein misfolding causing destabilization, cellular dimerization/aggregation and enhanced rate of degradation. In silico predicted conformational changes of the F260-L270 loop structure are considered to mediate the dimerization of both mutant proteins by a domain swapping mechanism. Thus, similar properties may represent the molecular mechanisms for additional unexplained GCK-MODY mutations, and may also contribute to the disease mechanism in other previously characterized GCK-MODY inactivating mutations."

In addition, we aimed to study predictors for attendance to the screening program. Register-based study using merged data from four national registries. All Norwegian-born women (1 168 832) and immigrant women (152 800) of screening age for cervical cancer (25-69 years) registered in Norway in 2008 were included. We grouped the immigrants by world's geographic region and carried out descriptive analyses and constructed several logistic regression models. The main outcome variable was whether the woman was registered with a Pap smear in 2008 or not. Immigrants had lower rates of participation compared with Norwegian-born women; Western Europe [adjusted odds ratio (OR), 95% confidence interval (CI): 0.84, 0.81-0.88], Eastern Europe (OR 0.64, 95% CI: 0.60-0.67), Asia (OR 0.74, 95% CI: 0.71-0.77), Africa (OR 0.61, 95% CI: 0.56-0.67) and South America (OR 0.87, 95% CI: 0.79-0.96). Younger age, higher income, residence in rural areas, and having a female general practitioner (GP) were associated with Pap smear. Longer residential time in Norway and having a nonimmigrant GP were associated with screening for some immigrant groups. Appropriate interventions targeting both immigrants and GPs need to be developed and evaluated."

One dataset comprised behavioral data from 1782 participants (885 females, 125 non-right-handers), who were divided in four age groups (children <10 yrs, adolescents = 10-15 yrs, younger adults = 16-49 yrs, and older adults >50 yrs). In addition, we had behavioral and functional imaging (fMRI) data from another 104 younger adults (49 females, aged 18-45 yrs), who completed the same dichotic listening task in a 3T scanner. This database allowed us to comprehensively test whether there is a sex difference in functional language lateralization. Across all participants and in both datasets a right ear advantage (REA) emerged, reflecting left-hemispheric language lateralization. Accordingly, the fMRI data revealed a leftward asymmetry in superior temporal lobe language processing areas. In the N = 1782 dataset no main effect of sex but a significant sex by age interaction emerged: the REA increased with age in both sexes but as a result of an earlier onset in females the REA was stronger in female than male adolescents. In turn, male younger adults showed greater asymmetry than female younger adults (accounting for <1% of variance). There were no sex differences in children and older adults. The males in the fMRI dataset (N = 104) also had a greater REA than females (accounting for 4% of variance), but no sex difference emerged in the neuroimaging data. Handedness did not affect these findings. Taken together, our findings suggest that sex differences in language lateralization as assessed with dichotic listening exist, but they are (a) not necessarily reflected in fMRI data, (b) age-dependent and (c) relatively small."

Volume: 81 Issue: 1 Oct 1996,1996,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8808646/,"Sarcoidosis is a multisystem granulomatous disorder of unknown etiology, predominantly affecting the lung. The increased concentration of pulmonary lymphocytes with specific receptors in subgroups of sarcoidosis patients suggests a local specific immune response. pso p27, a psoriatic scale antigen linked to the pathogenesis of psoriasis, was previously found in BAL cells, serum, and Kveim-Siltzback test in sarcoidosis. With an enzyme-linked immunoassay based on murine monoclonal antibodies, we analyzed BAL fluid from 21 patients with pulmonary sarcoidosis. Eleven (52%) of the patients have detectable levels of pso p27 antigen. No antigen is detected in the BAL fluid from five healthy, nonsmoking controls. Serum concentrations of pso p27 shows no significant difference between the two groups, but three of the sarcoidosis patients have detectable levels of the antigen. Mean concentration of pso p27 is >100 fold higher in BAL fluid than in serum from the sarcoidosis patients. This strongly suggests local pulmonary production of pso p27 antigen."
120,Does occurrence of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium in the middle-ear cavity always indicate a cholesteatoma?,15550180,The Journal of laryngology and otology. Volume: 118 Issue: 10 Oct 2004,2004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15550180/,"The origin and behaviour of keratinizing stratified squamous epithelium, an essential component of cholesteatoma occurring in the middle-ear cavity, has puzzled otologists for decades. In this experimental study in 16 cats, central (n = 23) and peripheral (n = 9) tympanic membrane perforations were observed for up to 63 days before sacrifice. The tympanic membranes with bony rim were excised, decalcified and embedded in Epon 812. Sections were stained with toluidine blue and examined using a light microscope. The perforation had been sealed by meatal epithelium exhibiting pronounced hyperplasia and keratin formation, lying on a bed of granulation tissue. Subtotal central perforations healed within 14 days, forming a bowl-shaped tympanic membrane and leaving parts of the handle of the malleus (with meatal epithelium) protruding freely into the middle-ear cavity. Stratified squamous epithelium, morphologically identical with that of external ear canal epidermis, could be observed on the malleus even 63 days after operation. This meatal epithelium was non-keratinizing, non-invasive, and showed no destructive properties typical of acquired cholesteatoma. During certain circumstances, the cell cycle of hyperplastic epidermal epithelium within the middle-ear cavity can evidently be arrested and inactivated by a local defence mechanism."

Volume: 48 Issue: 6 06 19 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29884460/,"PKCβ-null (Prkcb-/-) mice are severely immunodeficient. Here we show that mice whose B cells lack PKCβ failed to form germinal centers and plasma cells, which undermined affinity maturation and antibody production in response to immunization. Moreover, these mice failed to develop plasma cells in response to viral infection. At the cellular level, we have shown that Prkcb-/- B cells exhibited defective antigen polarization and mTORC1 signaling. While altered antigen polarization impaired antigen presentation and likely restricted the potential of GC development, defective mTORC1 signaling impaired metabolic reprogramming, mitochondrial remodeling, and heme biosynthesis in these cells, which altogether overwhelmingly opposed plasma cell differentiation. Taken together, our study reveals mechanistic insights into the function of PKCβ as a key regulator of B cell polarity and metabolic reprogramming that instructs B cell fate."

123,The active heroin metabolite 6-acetylmorphine has robust reinforcing effects as assessed by self-administration in the rat.,30578794,Neuropharmacology. Dec 19 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30578794/,"Previous studies have suggested that at least some of the behavioral effects of heroin might be mediated by its active metabolite 6-acetylmorphine (6-AM). The aim of the present study was to investigate the reinforcing effects of 6-AM and its role in mediating those of heroin. We used an intravenous self-administration procedure in male Sprague-Dawley rats including four phases: acquisition, extinction, reinstatement of drug-seeking, and re-acquisition. Independent groups of rats readily learned to self-administer equimolar doses (0.135 μmol/kg) of either 6-AM (44.3 μg/kg) or heroin (50 μg/kg). Under a fixed ratio 1 (FR1) schedule of reinforcement, the rate of responding was the same for 6-AM and heroin, but it was significantly higher for 6-AM than for heroin under a FR2 schedule. A non-contingent infusion ('priming') of 0.068 μmol/kg of either 6-AM or heroin reinstated non-reinforced drug-seeking (relapse). The rats readily re-acquired self-administration behaviour when given access to one of two doses (0.068 and 0.135 μmol/kg) of 6-AM or heroin. Pretreatment with a specific monoclonal antibody (mAb) against 6-AM blocked the priming effect of 6-AM, and modified the rate of lever-pressing on re-acquisition of 6-AM self-administration in a manner compatible with a shift to the right of the dose-effect curve. The mAb did not affect heroin responding. The present results show that 6-AM possesses reinforcing effects similar to those of heroin. The lack of effect of 6-AM mAb on heroin priming and heroin self-administration calls for further studies to clarify the role of heroin and its metabolites in heroin reward."

Volume: 56 Issue: Pt 7 Jul 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16825631/,"Alignment-independent phylogenetic methods have interesting properties for global phylogenetic reconstructions, particularly with respect to speed and accuracy. Here, we present a novel multimer-based alignment-independent bilinear mathematical modelling (AIBIMM) approach for global 16S rRNA gene phylogenetic analyses. In AIBIMM, jackknife cross-validated principal component analyses (PCA) are used to explain the variance in nucleotide n-mer frequency data. We compared AIBIMM with alignment-based distance, maximum-parsimony and maximum-likelihood phylogenetic methods, analysing taxa belonging to the Proteobacteria (n=82), Actinobacteria (n=30) and Archaea (n=7). These analyses indicated an attraction between the Actinobacteria and Archaea for the traditional methods, with the two taxa Acidimicrobium and Rubrobacter at the root of the tree. AIBIMM, on the other hand, showed that the Actinobacteria was tightly clustered, with Acidimicrobium and Rubrobacter within a distinct subgroup of the Actinobacteria. The application of AIBIMM was further evaluated, analysing full-length 16S rRNA gene sequences for 2818 taxa representing the prokaryotic domains. We obtained a highly structured description of the prokaryote diversity. Sample-to-model (Si) distances were also determined for taxa included in our work. We determined Si distances for models of the six major subgroups of taxa detected in the global analyses, in addition to nested subgroups within the Alphaproteobacteria. The Si-distance evaluation showed a very good separation of the taxa within the models from those outside. We conclude that AIBIMM represents a novel phylogenetic framework suitable for accommodating the current exponential growth of 16S rRNA gene sequences in the public domain."

All children born between 1980 and 1985 (N=30037) in Akershus County, Norway, were screened for possible MR and assessed with either IQ tests or standardized developmental tests. A total of 178 children, 79 with severe mental retardation (SMR) (IQ<50) and 99 with mild mental retardation (MMR) (IQ 50 to 70) were included for further study. Psychiatric symptomatology was assessed as a standard part of the neurodevelopmental examination, which included a semistructured parent interview, a clinical child interview, and retrieval of the charts of previous child psychiatric examinations. Psychiatric diagnoses were classified according to the International Classification of Disease (ICD-10). In total, 65 (37%) of the total population with MR (95% confidence intervals 29 to 44) were registered to have psychiatric diagnoses, the most common being hyperkinesia (n=28) and pervasive developmental disorder (n=15). Psychiatric diagnoses were present in 42% of the population with SMR and 33% of the population with MMR (p=0.4). Of all children found to have a psychiatric diagnosis, approximately one-third had previously been examined by a child psychiatrist and indicated a previously unrecognized need for these services to children with MR."
127,How does the radiation therapist affect the cancer patients' experience of the radiation treatment?,23731059,European journal of cancer care. Volume: 22 Issue: 5 Sep 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23731059/,"Previous studies of head and neck cancer patients going through radiation treatment have shown the treatment causes great physical as well as psychosocial problems. Although previous research acknowledges the needs of cancer patients, there is a lack of literature regarding the patient's perspective about radiation therapy. Studies have rarely focused on the whole experience of radiation treatment. The aim of this study was to illuminate how head and neck cancer patients' encounters with radiation therapists influence patients' experiences going through radiation therapy. The study was conducted via qualitative interviews, using a phenomenological hermeneutic approach. Eleven cancer patients were treated with radiation therapy. This study showed that encounters with radiation therapists have a significant influence on patients' experiences. Cancer patients' contact with radiation therapists can lead to increases or decreases in existential anxiety. When patients experience that the radiation therapist is professionally competent, the existential anxiety decreases. When the radiation therapist make time to build relationships and take responsibility for treatment and side effects, this creates a feeling of security and the treatment is easier to review. The study may indicate that the patients' existential anxiety increases when the radiation therapist shows professional incompetence. "

Volume: 7 Issue: 6 Dec 1987",1987,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/3427884/,"The mechanical function and perfusion in ischaemic and non-ischaemic myocardium after coronary occlusion was studied in 10 cats using pressure-length loop analysis and radiolabelled microspheres. Measurements in three regions--ischaemic, adjacent normal and remote normal myocardium--all showed different responses to coronary occlusion. In the ischaemic region loop area, segment shortening and tissue flow were markedly reduced. In the adjacent normal region, both loop area and segment shortening as well as flow increased. In the remote normal region, neither loop area, segment shortening nor flow showed consistent changes. End-diastolic segment length increased in all regions, most in the ischaemic region and least in the remote region. The increased end-diastolic segment length in all regions after coronary occlusion indicates activation of the Frank-Starling mechanism as an attempt to maintain stroke volume. However, the end-diastolic segment length did not increase uniformly for all normal myocardium: it depended on the proximity to the ischaemic region. Increased contractile function in the adjacent normal myocardium due to non-uniform distribution of the Frank-Starling effect is the most likely mechanism behind the left ventricle's ability to partially compensate for loss of contractile mass during acute regional ischaemia in anaesthetized cats."

It is usually understood in terms of decision making, 'knowing' the correct diagnosis or understanding how the human body works. Using the work of Ludwig Wittgenstein, Georges Canguilhem and Tim Ingold, I outline a story of journeying and habitation, and argue that while uncertainty for practitioners may be about enhancing theoretical knowledge, for patients it is about knowing how to act in a taken-for-granted and largely unconscious way in a world that has become uncertain, and in which the main tool of action, the human body, no longer functions with the certainty it once had. In this situation, the role of the practitioner is first and foremost to recognize the uncertainty that has emerged in the patient's 'habitation' and to reassure them by enabling them to have a new or restored confidence in their body so that they can act with certainty.

135,Effects of genetic drift and gene flow on the selective maintenance of genetic variation.,23457235,Genetics. Volume: 194 Issue: 1 May 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23457235/,"Explanations for the genetic variation ubiquitous in natural populations are often classified by the population-genetic processes they emphasize: natural selection or mutation and genetic drift. Here we investigate models that incorporate all three processes in a spatially structured population, using what we call a construction approach, simulating finite populations under selection that are bombarded with a steady stream of novel mutations. As expected, the amount of genetic variation compared to previous models that ignored the stochastic effects of drift was reduced, especially for smaller populations and when spatial structure was most profound. By contrast, however, for higher levels of gene flow and larger population sizes, the amount of genetic variation found after many generations was greater than that in simulations without drift. This increased amount of genetic variation is due to the introduction of slightly deleterious alleles by genetic drift and this process is more efficient when migration load is higher. The incorporation of genetic drift also selects for fitness sets that exhibit allele-frequency equilibria with larger domains of attraction: they are ""more stable."" Moreover, the finiteness of populations strongly influences levels of local adaptation, selection strength, and the proportion of allele-frequency vectors that can be distinguished from the neutral expectation."

Volume: 67 Issue: 3 Mar 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17688963/,"Concurrent event-related EEG-fMRI recordings pick up volume-conducted and hemodynamically convoluted signals from latent neural sources that are spatially and temporally mixed across the brain, i.e. the observed data in both modalities represent multiple, simultaneously active, regionally overlapping neuronal mass responses. This mixing process decreases the sensitivity of voxel-by-voxel prediction of hemodynamic activation by the EEG when multiple sources contribute to either the predictor and/or the response variables. In order to address this problem, we used independent component analysis (ICA) to recover maps from the fMRI and timecourses from the EEG, and matched these components across the modalities by correlating their trial-to-trial modulation. The analysis was implemented as a group-level ICA that extracts a single set of components from the data and directly allows for population inferences about consistently expressed function-relevant spatiotemporal responses. We illustrate the utility of this method by extracting a previously undetected but relevant EEG-fMRI component from a concurrent auditory target detection experiment."

To investigate the functionality and specificity of immunity proteins, immunity genes belonging to the bacteriocins curvacin A, enterocin A, enterocin P, leucocin A, pediocin PA-1 and sakacin P, as well as a putative immunity gene, orfY, were expressed in three bacteriocin-sensitive lactic acid bacteria (Lactobacillus sake, Carnobacterium piscicola and Enterococcus faecalis). The transformed indicator strains, each containing one of the immunity genes, were tested for sensitivity towards seven different purified bacteriocins (curvacin A, enterocin A, enterocin P, leucocin A, leucocin C, pediocin PA-1 and sakacin P). Cross-immunity was observed almost exclusively in situations where either the bacteriocins or the immunity proteins belonged to the same sequence-based subgroup. In a few cases, the functionality of immunity proteins was strain-dependent; e.g. the leucocin A immunity gene provided immunity to enterocin A, pediocin PA-1 and leucocin A in Ent. faecalis, whereas in the other two indicators, this gene provided immunity to leucocin A only. The orfY gene, which is transcribed without a cognate bacteriocin, was shown to encode a functional immunity protein that expands the bacteriocin resistance of the strain possessing this gene. The results show that the bacteriocin sensitivity of a lactic acid bacterium strain can depend on (1) the presence of immunity genes in connection with its own bacteriocin production, (2) the presence of extra immunity genes and (3) more general properties of the strain such as the membrane composition or the presence of receptors."

Intensification of domestic production and globalized expansion through increased trade result in reductions in global emissions by nearly 30% over a business-as-usual scenario, but at the expense of trading partners absorbing the associated negative externalities of environmental degradation. Only adoption of a mixed strategy combining global best-practice in sustainable intensification of domestic production, with increased green-source trading as a short-term coping strategy, can meet 2050 demand while minimizing the local and global environmental footprint of China's ruminant consumption boom."

No effect of stress could be observed when nu/nu BALB/c mice were subjected to water stress 3 days before and 6 days after tumour transplantation. However, BALB/c nu/nu mice pre-injected intraperitoneally with spleen cells from conventional mice had a decreased tumour size and growth rate of the tumour when stressed 3 days before and 6 days after tumour transplantation."

Volume: 82 Issue: 7 Jul 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21806207/,"Many effects and factors can influence the efficiency of a rocket plasma probe. These include payload charging, solar illumination, rocket payload orientation and rotation, and dust impact induced secondary charge production. As a consequence, considerable uncertainties can arise in the determination of the effective cross sections of plasma probes and measured electron and ion densities. We present a new method for calibrating mesospheric rocket plasma probes and obtaining reliable measurements of plasma densities. This method can be used if a payload also carries a probe for measuring the dust charge density. It is based on that a dust probe's effective cross section for measuring the charged component of dust normally is nearly equal to its geometric cross section, and it involves the comparison of variations in the dust charge density measured with the dust detector to the corresponding current variations measured with the electron and/or ion probes. In cases in which the dust charge density is significantly smaller than the electron density, the relation between plasma and dust charge density variations can be simplified and used to infer the effective cross sections of the plasma probes. We illustrate the utility of the method by analysing the data from a specific rocket flight of a payload containing both dust and electron probes."

Volume: 13 Issue: 5 Oct 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16965479/,"The task of enforcing behavioural limits in mental health settings is widely regarded as necessary but also potentially counter-therapeutic. There has been little discussion of the ideological basis for limit setting in psychiatry, and this paper attempts to locate the progress of this ideology from the moral treatment movement to contemporary medicalized psychiatry. It is suggested that limit setting has its foundations in the Enlightenment tradition of the autonomous individual and the power of reason, and in the dual functions of psychiatry as a therapeutic and social control system. The account draws on the work of critical psychiatry, as well as on recent research concerning the discourses and practices of mental health nurses, and concludes that these dual functions are inherent to the psychiatric project."

Volume: 13 Issue: 6 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8544656/,"31P MRS resonance ratios of tumors depend on the T1S of the phosphorus compounds. The objective of the 31P MRS study reported here was to investigate whether the phosphorus T1S of melanomas are influenced by the presence of melanin. One amelanotic (COX-t) and one melanotic (ROX-t) human melanoma xenograft line were studied at two different tumor volumes: 200 and 1000 mm3. 31P MRS was performed in nonanaesthetized mice at 4.7 T. The T1S were measured by using the superfast inversion recovery technique. Fraction of necrotic tissue in the tumors was determined by histological examination. The ROX-t tumors showed shorter T1S than the COX-t tumors at a volume of 200 mm3, where the fraction of necrotic tissue in the tumors was insignificant. The difference was similar in magnitude for all resonances. The T1S were not significantly different for COX-t and ROX-t at a volume of 1000 mm3, where the tumors of both lines had developed significant necrosis. The phosphorus T1S of melanomas without necrosis can be shortened significantly by the presence of melanin. The magnitude of the T1 shortening is similar for all major compounds. 31P MRS resonance ratios of melanomas are not altered significantly by correcting for effects of partial saturation."

Volume: 13 Issue: 2 May 2010",2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20155398/,"Recent contributions to discussions on paediatric cochlear implantation in Norway indicate two mutually exclusive doctrines prescribing the best course of post-operative support for a child with cochlear implants; bilingually with sign language and spoken language simultaneously or primarily monolingually with speech only. This conflict constitutes an ethical problem for parents responsible for choosing between one of the two alternatives. This article puts forth the precautionary principle as a possible solution to this problem. Although scientific uncertainty exists in the case of both doctrines, there exists a scenario of possible irreversible harm to some of the children habilitated monolingually. An application of the precautionary principle may hence suggest that it is rational to agree on the bilingual approach, at least for the time-being."

Volume: 150 11 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29042323/,"The aim of this study was to evaluate the natural occurrence of Beauveria spp. in soil, from infections in the stink bug Piezodorus guildinii, an important pest of common bean (Phaseolus vulgaris) and as endophytes in bean plant tissue. Twelve conventional and 12 organic common bean fields in the Villa Clara province, Cuba were sampled from September 2014 to April 2015. One hundred and fifty Beauveria isolates were obtained from soil samples, bean plant parts and stink bugs. The overall frequency of occurrence of Beauveria isolates in conventional fields (8.4%) was significantly lower than that in organic fields (23.6%). Beauveria were also obtained significantly more frequently from bean roots in organic fields (15.0%) compared to bean roots in conventional fields (3.3%). DNA sequencing of the intergenic Bloc region was performed for Beauveria species identification. All isolates where characterized as Beauveria bassiana (Balsamo-Crivelli) Vuillemin, and clustered with isolates of neotropical origin previously described as AFNEO_1. The Cuban B. bassiana isolates formed five clusters in the phylogeny. Isolates of two clusters originated from all four locations, organic and conventional fields, as well as soil, plants and stink bugs. Organic fields contained isolates of all five clusters while conventional fields only harbored isolates of the two most frequent ones. Mating type PCR assays revealed that mating type distribution was skewed, with MAT1/MAT2 proportion of 146/4, indicating limited potential for recombination. The present study is the first to report of B. bassiana as a naturally occurring endophyte in common bean. Further, it shows that B. bassiana occurs naturally in diverse environments of common bean fields, and constitutes a potential reservoir of natural enemies against pest insects particularly in organic fields."

Here, we propose a statistical approach to investigate and distinguish between linear and nonlinear dependences between DNA copy number alteration and mRNA expression."

In one treatment group, moderate emphasis on transference analysis was intended. In the other, minor or no use of the studied component was intended. The two treatment groups differed significantly in the use of transference interpretations and related interventions. There was no significant difference in therapists' general therapeutic skill or use of supportive interventions. The treatment differentiation was consistent with the manuals."

Volume: 53 Issue: 6 Dec 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30334567/,"Protein kinase B (Akt), similar to many other protein kinases, is at the crossroads of cell death and survival, playing a pivotal role in multiple interconnected cell signaling mechanisms implicated in cell metabolism, growth and division, apoptosis suppression and angiogenesis. Akt protein kinase displays important metabolic effects, among which are glucose uptake in muscle and fat cells or the suppression of neuronal cell death. Disruptions in the Akt‑regulated pathways are associated with cancer, diabetes, cardiovascular and neurological diseases. The regulation of the Akt signaling pathway renders Akt a valuable therapeutic target. The discovery process of Akt inhibitors using various strategies has led to the identification of inhibitors with great selectivity, low side‑effects and toxicity. The usefulness of Akt emerges beyond cancer therapy and extends to other major diseases, such as diabetes, heart diseases, or neurodegeneration. This review presents key features of Akt structure and functions, and presents the progress of Akt inhibitors in regards to drug development, and their preclinical and clinical activity in regards to therapeutic efficacy and safety for patients."
162,Smartphone Restriction and Its Effect on Subjective Withdrawal Related Scores.,30150959,Frontiers in psychology. Volume: 9 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30150959/,"Excessive smartphone use has been associated with a number of negative consequences for the individual and the environment. Some similarities can be observed between excessive smartphone usage and several behavioural addictions, and continual usage constitutes one of several characteristics included in addiction. In the extreme high end of the distribution of smartphone usage, smartphone restriction might be expected to elicit negative effects for individuals. These negative effects may be regarded as withdrawal symptoms traditionally associated with substance-related addictions. To address this timely issue, the present study examined scores on the Smartphone Withdrawal Scale (SWS), the Fear of Missing Out Scale (FoMOS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS) during 72 h of smartphone restriction. A sample of 127 participants (72.4% women), aged 18-48 years (M = 25.0, SD = 4.5), were randomly assigned into one of two conditions: a restricted condition (experimental group, n = 67) or a control condition (control group, n = 60). During the restriction period participants completed the aforementioned scales three times a day. The results revealed significantly higher scores on the SWS and FoMOS for participants allocated to the restricted condition than those assigned to the control condition. Overall the results suggest that smartphone restriction could cause withdrawal symptoms."

Volume: 85 Issue: 1 1996,1996,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8739938/,"298 women and 36 men, median age 80 (range 40-95) years with 340 femoral neck fractures were treated with Charnley-Hastings hemiarthroplasty and followed for 41 (range 12-86) months. 107 replacements were primary because of poor reduction and 233 were secondary, performed during 60 months after the injury because of disturbed fracture healing. The results of primary and secondary replacements regarding morbidity, mortality, prosthesis failure and survival were similar. The major postoperative complications were: early wound infection (10 cases, 2.9%), dislocation of the prosthesis (16 cases, 4.7%), fracture of femoral shaft (nine cases, 2.7%), and loosening of components with reoperation (six cases, 1.8%). In total 33 reoperations (9.7%) were performed. When failure of the prosthesis was defined as dislocation, fracture or removal of part or whole prosthesis, the three-year and six-year survival rates were 89 and 80%, respectively. Defining the failure as removal of prosthesis component(s) only, the success rates were 96 and 94%, respectively. We conclude that cemented bipolar prosthesis offers a good alternative for salvage of displaced or failed femoral neck fracture."

Volume: 30 Issue: 4 May 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18298629/,"The object of this study was to determine whether the magnitude of educational health inequalities varies between European countries with different welfare regimes. The data source is based on the first and second wave of the European Social Survey. The first health indicator describes people's mental and physical health in general, while the second reports cases of any limiting longstanding illness. Educational inequalities in health were measured as the difference in health between people with an average number of years of education and people whose educational years lay one standard deviation below the national average. Moreover, South European welfare regimes had the largest health inequalities, while countries with Bismarckian welfare regimes tended to demonstrate the smallest. Although the other welfare regimes ranked relatively close to each other, the Scandinavian welfare regimes were placed less favourably than the Anglo-Saxon and East European. Thus, this study shows an evident patterning of magnitudes of health inequalities according to features of European welfare regimes. Although the greater distribution of welfare benefits within the Scandinavian countries are likely to have a protective effect for disadvantaged cities in these countries, other factors such as relative deprivation and class-patterned health behaviours might be acting to widen health inequalities."

The causal mechanisms which generate these inequalities are linked to social change at the macro level. The present study asks whether patterns of ill-health according to women's statuses have changed during recent decades in Norway. Five national surveys 1968-91 are analyzed, using number of long-standing diseases as an indicator of health. The results indicate that health differences between full-time employed women and other employment statuses have increased during the 70s and 80s. As regards marital and parental status, the observed changes are not significant. The findings suggest that important causal mechanisms generating health differences related to marital status are located in the private sphere. The interpretation of the widening health gap between employed and non-employed women focuses both on developments which have made it easier to combine employment and family duties, on new norms which favour the self-esteem of employed women, and on health selection processes connected to welfare state developments."

The purpose of the workshop was to review the specific roles that high-content omics datasets (eg, transcriptomics, metabolomics, lipidomics, and proteomics) can hold within the adverse outcome pathway (AOP) framework for supporting ecological and human health risk assessments. In light of the growing number of examples of the application of omics data in the context of ecological risk assessment, we considered how omics datasets might continue to support the AOP framework. In particular, the role of omics in identifying potential AOP molecular initiating events and providing supportive evidence of key events at different levels of biological organization and across taxonomic groups was discussed. Areas with potential for short and medium-term breakthroughs were also discussed, such as providing mechanistic evidence to support chemical read-across, providing weight of evidence information for mode of action assignment, understanding biological networks, and developing robust extrapolations of species-sensitivity. Key challenges that need to be addressed were considered, including the need for a cohesive approach towards experimental design, the lack of a mutually agreed framework to quantitatively link genes and pathways to key events, and the need for better interpretation of chemically induced changes at the molecular level. This article was developed to provide an overview of ecological risk assessment process and a perspective on how high content molecular-level datasets can support the future of assessment procedures through the AOP framework."

Volume: 4 Issue: 4 Apr 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21577318/,"The recently advanced cancer stem cell model postulates that progression and metastasis of cancer are mainly driven by tumor cells with stem cell properties. Intestinal cancer stem cells are difficult to study due to the lack of reliable markers, but expression of the Wnt target gene Lgr5 is promising to define at least stem cell like cells in intestinal and colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to find a possible link of stem cell like cancer cells to the metastatic process of colorectal cancer. To this end, we evaluated immunohistochemical Lgr5 expression in 31 distant metastases and in primary tumor compartments with relevance for metastasizing, comprising 89 colorectal carcinomas. Lgr5 expression was seen in 51.6% of distant metastases. 12.9%, 14.8% and 26.7% of primary tumors with histologically confirmed tumor buds, angioinvasion and perineural infiltrates, respectively, showed evidence of Lgr5 expression in these tumor compartments. However, distant metastases, which were derived from carcinomas with such Lgr5 positive tumor compartments, showed 6- to 11.5-fold higher median value of Lgr5 expression compared to those metastases derived from tumors without Lgr5 expressing cells in these compartments. These differences between the metastases were statistically significant, if being related to tumor buds (all tumors; p = 0.047) and to vascular infiltrates (stage IV tumors; p = 0.007). In conclusion, our results point to rare evidence of Lgr5 positive stem cell like cells in the metastatic cascade of colorectal cancer, but these few cells might be biologically powerful in the metastatic process of cancer subsets. Clonal analysis is necessary to proof this hypothesis."

Volume: 48 Issue: 7 Nov 1988,1988,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2974174/,"Laser Doppler flowmetry (LDF) was used to evaluate lower limb resting skin perfusion in sixty subjects divided into four groups: healthy young and elderly controls, and patients with intermittent claudication or critical ischaemia. Measurements were performed in pulp skin containing microvascular AV anastomoses and in the skin of leg and thigh where these shunts are absent. In toe pulp controls and claudicators had higher perfusion values than in leg and thigh skin (p less than 0.01), indicating that the LDF method evaluates flow both in nutritional capillaries, AV anastomoses and in dermal vascular plexa. Elderly controls had higher flux values in the pulp than claudicators (p less than 0.01), and claudicators had higher values than patients with critical ischaemia (p less than 0.01), showing that LDF could differentiate between the clinical groups. Study of reproducibility confirmed that values were reproducible on a given population. Day to day variation was considerable in individual subjects, probably because of changes in sympathetic vascular tone and because of different vascular architecture in the measuring volumes which are only some few mm3. The fact that LDF measures total skin blood flow explains why several papers have found a poor correlation between LDF and methods which mainly evaluate nutritional blood flow. The method is non-invasive, continuous and easy to perform. Laser Doppler flowmetry may have several clinical applications, like evaluating progress of atherosclerotic disease or therapeutic effects of drugs or operations. To increase the reproducibility of resting skin flux measurements local heating of the skin is recommended and the measurements should be performed with an integrating probe, which averages the readings obtained at several positions simultaneously."

A computerized scanning microdensitometer was applied across various sites on vessels in fundus photographs. The Ir of the reflected light was significantly reduced in diabetic arteries and veins compared to the vessels in the control group (P less than 0.001). This may implicate abnormalities in blood rheology of the retinal circulation in diabetes. The Wr/Wo was found narrower in veins in diabetic patients (P less than 0.001). This probably indicates differences in haemodynamics of venous flow in diabetic and normal subjects. The intensity was correlated to the duration of diabetes (P less than 0.05), while neither the width nor the intensity were found related to sex, metabolic control, intraocular pressure or retinopathy."

Due to the diverse action on a wide variety of organs, HT/ET has the capacity to improve quality of life in most postmenopausal women,- more than other more specific osteoporosis treatments. The initial optimism associated with HRT 20-30 years ago was reduced considerably after the HT arm of WHI was stopped prematurely due to safety concerns. Later analyses of the WHI study have, however, tempered the negative messages emerging from the first publication in 2002. HT/ET still constitutes a first line choice for prevention of bone loss and fracture in the early postmenopausal period for a period of 5 years. However, in women with low risk of adverse events classically associated with HT/ET newer analyses show that treatment can be continued with an acceptable risk benefit ratio. These analyses have also highlighted the negative impact of progestogens on breast cancer risk an adverse effects on the cardiovascular system. Newer guidelines therefore suggest that a combination of a progestogen IUD and transdermal estrogen seems to be the best alternative for long term treatment. This combination minimizes cardiovascular safety concerns by avoiding the negative impact of first pass metabolism in the liver seen with oral compounds and minimizes exposure to progestogens. SERMS are valuable alternatives, particularly in osteopenic women (t-score -1,0 to -2,5) at increased risk of breast cancer, but their general lack of anti fracture efficacy towards non vertebral fractures limits their use in women at high risk of osteoporotic fracture."

Volume: 145 11 15 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30193194/,"This paper studies the hydraulic performance of two swales composed of filters for stormwater management (filtering swales) in a large-scale experimental study and compares them to the performance of a swale composed of traditional bioretention soil (bioswale). Using experimental data, dimensionless formulations are derived to reflect the influence of swale design parameters on hydraulic performance. The developed formulas can be used to design swales accounting for practical factors for decision makers such as local rainfall patterns, volume capture requirements, and drainage area. The experimental data show that while the bioswale is characterized by large overland flows, the tested filtering swales manage, in the majority of cases, the complete inflow volume without overland flow. The longitudinal slope of the swales does not affect the infiltration capacity of the filtering swales for the tested experimental boundary conditions, only the inflow rate and media water content are found to be statistically significant. As an example, filtering swales tested in this study captured 90% of the runoff generated by a 12.2 mm/h storm (approximately a 5-year return period 1-h duration storm event in the city of Trondheim) on a road 40 times larger than the swale. This highlights the capacity of such swales for handling infrequent events."

We investigate the composition of active and total mucosal microbiota of treatment-naïve ulcerative colitis (UC) patients to determine the microbial picture at the start-up phase of disease, using both a 16S rRNA transcript and gene amplicon sequencing. DNA and RNA were isolated from the same mucosal colonic biopsies. Our aim was to identify active microbial members of the microbiota in early stages of disease and reveal which members are present, but do not act as major players. We demonstrated differences in active and total microbiota of UC patients when comparing inflamed to non-inflamed tissue. Several taxa, among them the Proteobacteria phyla and families therein, revealed lower transcriptional activity despite a high presence. The Bifidobacteriaceae family of the Actinobacteria phylum showed lower abundance in the active microbiota, although no difference in presence was detected. The most abundant microbiota members of the inflamed tissue in UC patients were not the most active. Knowledge of active members of microbiota in UC patients could enhance our understanding of disease etiology. The active microbial community composition did not deviate from the total when comparing UC patients to non-IBD controls."

We sought to define the genomic spectrum and associated outcomes of a diverse cohort of children who met the HLH-2004 criteria. Genetic testing was performed clinically or through research-based whole-exome sequencing. Clinical metrics were analyzed with respect to genomic results. Of 122 subjects enrolled over the course of 17 years, 101 subjects received genetic testing. Biallelic familial HLH (fHLH) gene defects were identified in only 19 (19%) and correlated with presentation at younger than 1 year of age (P < .0001). Digenic fHLH variants were observed but lacked statistical support for disease association. In 28 (58%) of 48 subjects, research whole-exome sequencing analyses successfully identified likely molecular explanations, including underlying primary immunodeficiency diseases, dysregulated immune activation and proliferation disorders, and potentially novel genetic conditions. Two-thirds of patients identified by the HLH-2004 criteria had underlying etiologies for HLH, including genetic defects, autoimmunity, and malignancy. Overall survival was 45%, and increased mortality correlated with HLH triggered by infection or malignancy (P < .05). Differences in survival did not correlate with genetic profile or extent of therapy. HLH should be conceptualized as a phenotype of critical illness characterized by toxic activation of immune cells from different underlying mechanisms. In most patients with HLH, targeted sequencing of fHLH genes remains insufficient for identifying pathogenic mechanisms. Whole-exome sequencing, however, may identify specific therapeutic opportunities and affect hematopoietic stem cell transplantation options for these patients."

These compounds are secondary metabolites produced by the fungal species F. culmorum and F. graminearum. Acetonitrile-water extract of the samples was purified on a Mycosep #225 column, derivetized using penta-fluoropropionic anhydride (PFPA) and analysed by gas chromatography-mass spectrometry (GC-MS). The amount of each of culmorin, 5-, 12-, 14 and 15-hydroxy-culmorin and one unknown hydroxy-culmorin were determined relative to the amount of DON plus 3-acetyl DON for each sample. The ratio between the total amount of culmorin compounds and the DON compounds ranged from 0.14 to 1.07 in the samples. This study shows that there is a strong correlation between the amount of DON present in the grain and the amount of culmorin and hydroxy-culmorins present. The ratio of each of the culmorin compounds relative to the amount of DON compounds were in the same range in the grain artificially inoculated by F. culmorum as found in an earlier study for F. culmorum strains cultivated on rice, while the hydroxy-culmorin profile in the naturally contaminated grain was more similar to what was found for the F. graminearum cultures in the same study. These results indicate that F. graminearum may be a relatively important source for DON in grain also in relatively cold areas."

This notion has recently been challenged because cultured microvascular endothelial cells (ECs) derived from various organs are unable to express VCAM-1 after exposure to IL-4. In this study, we have established a method for isolation and culture of nasal polyp-derived microvascular ECs and report their cytokine-regulated VCAM-1 expression. With a combination of cell enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, flow cytometry, and reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction, such expression was shown to be induced in a dose- and time-dependent manner not only by IL-1 beta and tumor necrosis factor-alpha but also by IL-4 and IL-13. Therefore, the response of nasal microvascular ECs did not harmonize with that of counterparts from several other tissues. IL-4 or IL-13 combined with submaximal concentrations of IL-1 beta or tumor necrosis factor-alpha increased VCAM-1 expression in a synergistic manner. VCAM-1 was functional as shown by antibody-mediated inhibition of leukocyte adhesion. Taken together, our results supported the notion that selective VCAM-1 induction by IL-4 and IL-13 plays an important role for the preferential recruitment of eosinophils and T lymphocytes seen in human airways affected by allergy."

This type of PTO is indicated in patients with genu varus malalignment and isolated medial compartment osteoarthritis of the knee, prior to or concurrent with medial compartment cartilage procedures or meniscal transplants, chronic posterolateral corner deficiency, or chronic anterior cruciate ligament deficiency. When treating ligamentous instability, a PTO can be performed in isolation, with simultaneous ligament reconstruction, or as a staged procedure with the osteotomy first, followed by ligament reconstruction if instability persists. Failure to address malalignment in cases of concurrent ligament reconstruction leads to increased stress on the graft and potential graft failure. One distinct advantage of this procedure is the ability to correct deformities in the sagittal and coronal planes. The purpose of this article was to describe our technique used to perform a medial opening wedge PTO."

Volume: 22 Issue: 9 Sep 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12959547/,"We studied the relationship between increasing age and blood concentrations of four persistent organochlorines (OCs), hexachlorbenzene (HCB), oxychlordane, p,p'-dichlorodiphenyldichloroethylene (DDE), and 2,2',4,4',5,5'-hexachlorbiphenyl (PCB-153), in arctic-breeding glaucous gulls (Larus hyperboreus). We measured OC concentrations in 31 individuals of known age and took repeated blood samples of 64 individuals in different years, either one year apart or three or four years apart. The age of individuals was not related to the blood concentrations for any of the four compounds, and in birds whose values were measured repeatedly, there was no effect of the length of time (number of years) between sampling events on the relative change in OC concentration. This indicates that steady-state levels were reached before the age of first breeding. However, breeding area significantly influenced the changes in OC concentration between sampling events. In areas in which birds fed on prey from higher trophic levels, the OC concentrations showed large increases between sampling events; in areas in which birds fed at lower trophic levels, OC concentrations increased relatively little or not at all. This indicates that individual birds had different equilibrium concentrations, which are reached at different ages depending on the intake of OCs through the food. It also indicates that some individuals had not reached steady-state concentrations at the onset of reproduction. Changes in body condition and amount of blood lipids were of lesser importance than trophic level and influenced the concentrations of HCB and oxychlordane more strongly than DDE and PCB-153. In conclusion, this study indicates that steady-state concentrations of persistent OCs are reached early in life in most glaucous gulls, considering the long life span of the species."

Sep 19 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30229973/,"A question has been raised in recent years as to whether the risk field, including analysis, assessment, and management, ought to be considered a discipline on its own. As suggested by Terje Aven, unification of the risk field would require a common understanding of basic concepts, such as risk and probability; hence, more discussion is needed of what he calls ""foundational issues."" In this article, we show that causation is a foundational issue of risk, and that a proper understanding of it is crucial. We propose that some old ideas about the nature of causation must be abandoned in order to overcome certain persisting challenges facing risk experts over the last decade. In particular, we discuss the challenge of including causally relevant knowledge from the local context when studying risk. Although it is uncontroversial that the receptor plays an important role for risk evaluations, we show how the implementation of receptor-based frameworks is hindered by methodological shortcomings that can be traced back to Humean orthodoxies about causation. We argue that the first step toward the development of frameworks better suited to make realistic risk predictions is to reconceptualize causation, by examining a philosophical alternative to the Humean understanding. In this article, we show how our preferred account, causal dispositionalism, offers a different perspective in how risk is evaluated and understood."

The term biosimilar can be defined as a biotherapeutic product that is similar in efficacy, safety and quality to the licensed reference product. Biosimilars may lead to a reduced price and significant cost savings for the health community and hopefully more patients globally will have easier access to biological therapy when indicated. CT-P13, which is a TNF-alfa inhibitor, is the first monoclonal antibody biosimilar being used in clinical practice. The drug is approved for all indications as an innovator product although clinical efficacy has only been demonstrated in rheumatic diseases. Until now the number of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) treated with CT-P13 is confined, but experience is continuously growing. Based on current data, CT-P13 seems to be efficacious and generally well tolerated in IBD especially in patients who are naïve to biological therapy. Knowledge with regard to interchangeability between CT-P13 and the originator infliximab is however, still rather sparse and more data are desired. Immunogenicity and long-term safety related to CT-P13 are other areas of great importance and good and reliable postmarketing pharmacovigilance is therefore required in the coming years. "

Volume: 314 Issue: 20 Dec 10 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18845141/,"Tunneling nanotube (TNT)-like structures are intercellular membranous bridges that mediate the transfer of various cellular components including endocytic organelles. To gain further insight into the magnitude and mechanism of organelle transfer, we performed quantitative studies on the exchange of fluorescently labeled endocytic structures between normal rat kidney (NRK) cells. This revealed a linear increase in both the number of cells receiving organelles and the amount of transferred organelles per cell over time. The intercellular transfer of organelles was unidirectional, independent of extracellular diffusion, and sensitive to shearing force. In addition, during a block of endocytosis, a significant amount of transfer sustained. Fluorescence microscopy revealed TNT-like bridges between NRK cells containing F-actin but no microtubules. Depolymerization of F-actin led to the disappearance of TNT and a strong inhibition of organelle exchange. Partial ATP depletion did not affect the number of TNT but strongly reduced organelle transfer. Interestingly, the myosin II specific inhibitor S-(-)-blebbistatin strongly induced both organelle transfer and the number of TNT, while the general myosin inhibitor 2,3-butanedione monoxime induced the number of TNT but significantly inhibited transfer.

Volume: 139 Jan 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25464042/,"Four radionuclide dispersion models have been applied to simulate the transport and distribution of (137)Cs fallout from Chernobyl accident in the Baltic Sea. Models correspond to two categories: box models and hydrodynamic models which solve water circulation and then an advection/diffusion equation. In all cases, interactions of dissolved radionuclides with suspended matter and bed sediments are included. Model results have been compared with extensive field data obtained from HELCOM database. Inventories in the water column and seabed, as well as (137)Cs concentrations along 5 years in water and sediments of several sub-basins of the Baltic, have been used for model comparisons. Values predicted by the models for the target magnitudes are very similar and close to experimental values. Results suggest that some processes are not very relevant for radionuclide transport within the Baltic Sea, for instance the roles of the ice cover and, surprisingly, water stratification. Also, results confirm previous findings concerning multi-model applications. "
216,Rapid growth causes abnormal vaterite formation in farmed fish otoliths.,28596212,The Journal of experimental biology. Volume: 220 Issue: Pt 16 08 15 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28596212/,"Sagittal otoliths are essential components of the sensory organs that enable all teleost fish to hear and maintain balance, and are primarily composed of calcium carbonate. A deformity, where aragonite (the normal crystal form) is replaced with vaterite, was first noted over 50 years ago but its underlying cause is unresolved. We evaluated the prevalence of vateritic otoliths from two captive rearing studies which suggested that fast growth, due to environmental rather than genetic control, led to vaterite development. We then tested this by varying light and temperature to create phenotypes with different growth rates, which resulted in fast growers (5 times larger) having 3 times more vaterite than slow growers. A decrease in either the ratio of otolith matrix proteins (otolin-1/OMM-64) or [Ca2+]/[CO32-] may explain why fast growth causes vaterite deposition. As vaterite decreases hearing sensitivity, reducing growth rates in hatcheries may improve the welfare of farmed fish and increase the success of conservation efforts."

Volume: 33 10 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29129673/,"The analysis of longitudinal neuroimaging data within the massively univariate framework provides the opportunity to study empirical questions about neurodevelopment. Missing outcome data are an all-to-common feature of any longitudinal study, a feature that, if handled improperly, can reduce statistical power and lead to biased parameter estimates. The goal of this paper is to provide conceptual clarity of the issues and non-issues that arise from analyzing incomplete data in longitudinal studies with particular focus on neuroimaging data. This paper begins with a review of the hierarchy of missing data mechanisms and their relationship to likelihood-based methods, a review that is necessary not just for likelihood-based methods, but also for multiple-imputation methods. Next, the paper provides a series of simulation studies with designs common in longitudinal neuroimaging studies to help illustrate missing data concepts regardless of interpretation. Finally, two applied examples are used to demonstrate the sensitivity of inferences under different missing data assumptions and how this may change the substantive interpretation. The paper concludes with a set of guidelines for analyzing incomplete longitudinal data that can improve the validity of research findings in developmental neuroimaging research."

Volume: 6 Issue: 2 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8746451/,"NGFI-B is an immediate early gene and orphan member of the nuclear receptor superfamily. It is induced in several tissues, including brain, and in cultured cerebellar granule cells in response to different stimuli. Since both the induction of its mRNA as well as the level and function of its gene product are under the control of the inducing stimulus, we wanted to study the final outcome of the stimulus, i.e., transcriptional activity, by means of a specific, artificial reporter gene in cultured CNS cells. Cultured cerebellar granule cells and astrocytes were transfected with an NGFI-B responsive reporter gene to study the role of NGFI-B as a transcriptional activator after stimulation of the protein kinase A and C pathways. In both cell types, stimulation of either protein kinase A or C with forskolin (10 microM) or phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (0.1 microM), respectively, gave up to fivefold induction of the reporter gene. In the granule cells a combined treatment gave a strong synergistic induction of the reporter gene. The astrocytes showed only weak synergy, indicating cell-specific regulation of the target gene by the two kinases."

The amount of TNF bound to the Dynabeads was quantified using either a polyclonal antibody to TNF or a mouse monoclonal antibody to TNF. The antibodies used for detection were either labelled with 125I or peroxidase. The linear assay range for the TNF standard curve was form 62 to 4000 pg/ml, and the assay time was less than 60 min. The sensitivity could be increased 5-8-fold by increasing the sample volume from 0.1 to 2 ml."

Results indicated similar developmental trends for all memory measures, ToM, and inhibition, but ToM and inhibition were not associated with any memory measures. Correlations involving source memory was found in relation to specific questions, whereas inhibition and ToM were significantly correlated to resistance to suggestions. A regression analysis showed that age was the main contributor to resistance to suggestions, to correct source monitoring, and to correct responses to specific questions. Inhibition was also a significant main predictor of resistance to suggestive questions, whereas the relative contribution of ToM was wiped out when an extended model was tested."

The IUHPE needs to help liberate knowledge producers everywhere from unnecessary structures, and find innovative ways to illuminate knowledge for all to see. We have developed and proven the effectiveness of a range of technologies such as settings-based health promotion. However, the vast majority of communities are untouched, and the IUHPE needs to be a leader in finding ways to better disseminate effective health promotion practice. The IUHPE is a vigorous and effective advocate for health promotion training, practice and research. Now we need to expand our advocacy for equity in health, building on our effective work on social clauses in trade agreements and on tobacco control."

Questions for self-evaluation are commonly used that provide no information of with what to compare (comparison target) one's olfactory function. We therefore investigated whether responses differed between an unspecific question and two questions providing comparison targets. Ninety-six healthy community-dwelling individuals (62.5 % women) aged 49-80 years evaluated their odor identification ability, followed by standardized assessment of odor identification ability. Results revealed that response patterns varied significantly depending on comparison target. While 81 % reported normal function when no further comparison target was presented, 69 % reported normal function when referring to age-related olfactory changes in identification ability. In turn, sensitivity of the accuracy of self-reported reduced odor identification ability (with standardized assessment as reference) increased from 11 to 37 %, whereas specificity decreased from 86 to 71 % when providing a comparison target. Accuracy of self-reported olfactory function can be increased by including a comparison target. However, standardized assessment is to be preferred over self-reported assessment, irrespective of how the question is formulated."

To ensure comparability of exercise levels only patients who obtained their predicted maximal heart rate in the initial test were included. All trained 3-4 hours daily 5 days a week at an average maximal intensity of 85% of their initial peak heart rate. They performed 2 maximal exercise tests before and 1 after the training course. Maximal oxygen consumption was 28.1 +/- 5.3 and 28.8 +/- 6.5 ml/kg/minute (NS) before, and increased by 16% to 33.4 +/- 7.2 after training (P less than 0.01). Treadmill exercise distance was 510 +/- 153 and 559 +/- 163 meters (10% increase, P less than 0.01) before, and increased by 14% to 638 +/- 156 after (P less than 0.01). Heart rate, ratio of respiratory gas exchange, and breathing frequency remained unchanged in all three tests at maximal exercise, but were significantly lower at identical submaximal levels after training, while the respiratory tidal volume increased. Resting heart rate decreased by 12% after (P less than 0.01). Thus, aerobic exercise performance is improved by short-term training after myocardial infarction. By the longitudinal design of the study, and the maximal initial exercise test, this physiological improvement can be differentiated from that of increased motivation, and of increased treadmill exercise distance due to improved exercise technique."

The data on births and all-cause deaths are adjusted for seasonal and trend effects, and the residual components of the 2 time series coinciding with the timing of peak influenza mortality are examined for these sequelae. Notable findings include: 1) a drop in births in the 3 months following peak mortality; 2) a reversion in births to normal levels occurring 5-7 months after peak mortality; and 3) a steep drop in births occurring 9-10 months after peak mortality. Interpreted in the context of parallel data showing elevated premature births, stillbirths, and maternal mortality during times of peak influenza mortality, these findings suggest that the main impacts of the 1918-1920 influenza on reproduction occurred through: 1) impaired conceptions, possibly due to effects on fertility and behavioral changes; 2) an increase in the preterm delivery rate during the peak of the pandemic; and 3) elevated maternal and fetal mortality, resulting in late-term losses in pregnancy."

We compared the metazoan parasite community of an introduced three-spined stickleback (Gasterosteus aculeatus) population with that of the nearby source population in subarctic Norway. As expected from a small spatial scale (5 km), the parasite component communities in the two lakes were highly similar. All identifiable allogenic parasite taxa (Diphyllobothrium dendriticum, Diphyllobothrium ditremum, Diphyllobothrium spp., Schistocephalus solidus, Apatemon sp. and Diplostomum spp.) were also observed in both lakes while inter-lake differences were driven by autogenic parasite taxa (Eubothrium spp., Crepidostomum spp., Nematoda spp., Proteocephalus sp. and Gyrodactylus arcuatus). Contrary to expectation, the total number of parasite taxa was higher in the introduced stickleback population (12) compared to that found in the source population (9) with three parasite taxa (Eubothrium spp., Crepidostomum spp., Nematoda spp.) only occurring in the introduced population. These parasites were uncommon however and normally restricted to salmonids. Sticklebacks from both populations were heavily infected, particularly with eye-infecting metacercariae. Sequences from the DNA barcode region of cytochrome oxidase 1 indicated that these include Diplostomum lineage 6, a member of the Diplostomum baeri complex and a member of the Strigeinae. Despite high similarity between the two component communities, quantitative inter-lake differences were found at the infracommunity level. At this scale, parasite intensity was significantly higher in the source population for the two autogenic stickleback specialists: G. arcuatus and Proteocephalus sp., assumed to be the autogenic stickleback specialist Proteocephalus filicollis. Parasite infracommunities within each lake also resembled each other significantly more than infracommunities between lakes, primarily driven by the allogenic cestode D. ditremum, as well as G. arcuatus and Proteocephalus sp. Overall, quantitative dissimilarities between the two parasite communities were possibly explained by inter-lake differences in the density of sticklebacks and intermediate hosts."

Crystallization of the title compound produced very bulky crystals. Rather than reducing the size of one of these before data collection, three data sets with different exposure times were collected with a Siemens SMART CCD diffractometer on a very large specimen (2.2 x 2.0 x 0.8 mm). The crystal was subsequently shaped into a 0.30 mm-diameter sphere for collection of two additional data sets. The discussion of the refinement results focus on the effect of absorption correction for the various data sets, and a comparison of geometrical and thermal parameters. One advantage of using a large crystal, the great speed with which data can be obtained, has been exemplified by collection of a complete data set of good quality in less than 25 min."

The evidence is derived from a series of interviews with executives at industrial vaccine developing organizations with pneumococcal vaccines in their R&D portfolio, including both multinational pharmaceutical companies and 'emerging' manufacturers. The main findings are that so far there is no evidence to support any claim that the AMC is speeding innovation of pneumococcal vaccines, or that it is contributing to productive capacity expansion. Representatives of emerging manufacturers consistently state that the AMC is either irrelevant or inappropriate for supporting their innovative activities on pneumococcal vaccines."

Training was conducted outside working hours as two to three 1-h weekly sessions the first 3 months and once a week the last 6 months. Tests were conducted at baseline, after 3 and 9 months. The soccer group improved maximal neck extension strength both after 3 (1.2 kg; P < 0.05) and 9 months (1.7 kg; P < 0.01) compared to the control group. The Zumba group improved maximal trunk extension strength (3.1 kg; P = 0.04) after 3 months, with improvements in postural sway velocity moment (-9.2 mm(2)/s; P < 0.05) and lower limb lean mass (0.4 kg; P < 0.05) after 9 months. No significant intervention effects were revealed in vertical jump height or sit-and-reach flexibility. The present study indicates that workplace-initiated soccer and Zumba exercise may be beneficial for improvement of the neck and trunk strength, which may have preventive effects with regard to future perceived muscle pain in the respective body regions. Furthermore, the Zumba group revealed positive effects on lower limb lean mass and postural sway compared to the control group. "
241,A novel vertebrate svp-related nuclear receptor is expressed as a step gradient in developing rhombomeres and is affected by retinoic acid.,8541212,Mechanisms of development. Volume: 52 Issue: 2-3 Aug 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8541212/,"The protein encoded by the zebrafish gene svp[40] belongs to a distinct group within the steroid hormone receptor superfamily that includes Drosophila seven-up and several vertebrate orphan receptors. Svp[40] shares a particularly high degree of amino acid sequence identity (approximately 86%) with the mammalian transcription factors ARP-1 and COUP. The gene is expressed in specific regional and segmental domains within the developing brain. Correspondence between this expression pattern and early sites of neuronal differentiation and axonogenesis in the rostral brain may reflect an involvement in neural patterning. During the early embryonic stages when hindbrain rhombomeres are formed, a segmental expression pattern is established as a step gradient. The single steps of this gradient coincide directly with the four anteriormost segments suggesting a role in controlling rhombomere-specific expression of genes contributing to cell differentiation in the hindbrain. Since COUP/ARP-1 and retinoic acid receptors (RARs/RXRs) are known to have similar DNA-binding specificities, different levels of Svp[40] might modulate retinoid signaling through competition for binding to specific RAREs in the promoters of target genes. Treatment of zebrafish embryos with retinoic acid affects the svp[40] step gradient and causes an elimination of a regional expression domain in the retina. These observations are consistent with svp[40] being an integral part of the retinoid signaling network during hindbrain and eye development."

We have studied how other important CKD variables predict the arginine/ADMA ratio.
247,Integrating spiritual care into nursing education and practice: Strategies utilizing Open Journey Theory.,30216754,Nurse education today. Volume: 71 Dec 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30216754/,"Throughout nursing, spirituality is a recognized domain of patient care, but nurses feel ill prepared by their nursing education to provide care that is spiritual in nature to patients and their families. Incorporating spiritual care into nursing curricula is challenging in light of the amount of topics for healthcare learning. Open Journey Theory is based on the merging of two grounded theories, one teaching and one learning theory, and is the suggested framework for integrating spirituality and spiritual care across all levels of nursing education. Specially chosen readings (books, articles), activities (role-plays, discussion groups), and assignments (journaling, writing papers, giving reports) can be integrated into already existing courses. By utilizing the three stages of preparing, connecting, and reflecting to frame student learning, nurse educators can introduce and build on spiritual concepts from the simple to the complex over the course of the entire nursing program."

A value of 30 mmHg has been used as the threshold for fasciotomy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate this practice. Sixty-three patients were included in the series. Forty-three fractures were closed, 18 grade I (Gustilo) and two grade II. Tissue pressure measurements were performed in 43 patients. Eighteen legs were treated with decompressive fasciotomy, three on clinical findings alone, and 15 after measurement of a pressure higher than 30 mmHg. This gives a fasciotomy rate of 29%. At follow-up two patients were dead. All fractures were healed, and there were no major complications such as deep infection, extensive muscle necrosis, paresis or short-foot syndrome. Three fasciotomized patients had significantly reduced muscle strength compared with the contralateral leg."

Exposure information was collected through postal questionnaires. Based on follow-up of 30,118 postmenopausal women by linkage to national registers of cancer, deaths, and emigration we revealed 540 incident breast cancer cases between 1996 and 2004. Compared to never users of either drugs current use of HRT gave a significant (p = 0.002) higher risk of breast cancer in former OC users, RR = 2.45 (95% CI 1.92-3.12), than among never users of OCs, RR = 1.67 (1.32-2.12). Relative risk of current use of HRT was similar for estrogen only and combinations with progestin added in ever users of OCs. The increased risk of breast cancer in current HRT users with a history of former OC use could have potential great impact on postmenopausal breast cancer risk as the proportion of postmenopausal women with former OC use will continue to increase."

The enterotoxigenic bacteria Vibrio cholerae O1, Vibrio cholerae non-O1 (NAG), Yersinia enterocolitica, and E. coli harboring the plasmid vectors of the polynucleotide gene probes were examined for further evaluation of probe specificity. The two classes of probes showed a perfect concordance in their specific detection and differentiation of enterotoxigenic E. coli. In the analysis of six strains, the signal strength on autoradiography after hybridization with oligonucleotides was weaker than that obtained after hybridization with polynucleotide probes. The probes did not hybridize with DNA from V. cholerae O1, V. cholerae non-O1 (NAG), or Y. enterocolitica. The strains of E. coli harboring the plasmid vectors of the polynucleotide gene probes were, likewise, negative in the hybridization assays."

Background:
 Physical activity (PA) in natural environments, known as green exercise (GE), can provide health benefits above and beyond PA in other environments, but little is known about the extent to which GE is an accessible form of weekly PA across different social groups. This study aims to examine the ""GE phenomenon"" in Norway, and evaluate possible differences in GE habits and perceived factors that promote GE across sub-groups of this population. 
Methods:
 2168 adults from all over Norway reported weekly GE and other forms of PA, specific forms of GE, and perceived factors that promote GE. Data were examined in the overall sample and in relation with the respondents' PA status and sociodemographic characteristics. 
Results:
 GE, especially ""walking in the forest"" and ""activities by/on the sea"", was the most popular form of weekly PA, even among those with low PA levels. GE was fairly represented across all social groups, and especially among the elderly, those who live with spouse/partner and those who live in the west regions of Norway, while no associations were found in relation to sex, centrality, education level or household income. ""Time flexibility"" and ""PA-supportive places"" were generally perceived as the most important factors that promote GE across all social groups. ""Accessibility to nature"" was generally perceived relatively little important, though a gradient was observed in relation to age, education level and household income. 
Conclusions:
 GE is an important source of weekly PA and health among adult Norwegians, especially in sub-groups of interest for public health such as the elderly, those with lower socio-economic status and those who live in non-urban areas. More should be done to understand and address the inequities relative to the perceived accessibility to nature."

In this paper, I refer specifically to instances that are complex as they are related to the profound epistemological problem of underdetermination. The underdetermination thesis states that theories are underdetermined by data, meaning that any set of data is logically compatible with different scientific theories. For the medical practitioners, this means that there is a risk that the analysis they give or the judgments they make might be incorrect. As being incorrect might lead to patients experiencing additional, more intense or prolonged suffering, it is very important that uncertainty is dealt with in a professional way. The ancient scepticism proposed by Sextus Empiricus and the professional scepticism in auditing of today both offer systematic approaches to what is uncertain that might work also in a medical setting."

Volume: 104 Issue: 1 May 1994,1994,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7950407/,"Five successively located peptides, in region 11-70 of the major allergen of ovalbumin (OA) Gal d I (11-19, 20-33, 34-46, 47-55, 56-70), were obtained by manual solid-phase peptide synthesis. These peptides together with the previously reported OA region 1-10 comprise a segment of 70 amino acid residues located at the N-terminal of ovalbumin. The crude peptides were purified by gel filtration and reversed-phase high-performance liquid chromatographies and their sequences were verified. Polyclonal antibodies against the peptides conjugated to carrier protein (BSA) were raised in rabbits. Rocket line immunoelectrophoresis showed that four peptides (20-33, 34-46, 47-55 and 56-70), could deflect OA-line immunoprecipitates. The peptide's affinity to rabbit polyclonal Ig was examined by quantitative precipitation inhibition and the results suggested that an epitope was encompassed in segments 34-55 and 47-55. Allergenicity was tested by inhibition of specific IgE binding of ovalbumin, using several sera and a serum pool from 16 egg-allergic patients. The results showed that the allergenicity was distributed over the whole region. These findings suggested that: (a) the region 11-70 of OA seemed not to encompass continuous epitopes; (b) the antigenicity of this region was convincing for peptides 34-46 and 47-55; (c) the allergenicity, though dependent on the patient serum used, was distributed over the whole of region 11-70; (d) peptide 11-19, although weak antigenically was capable of specific IgE inhibition; (e) human and rabbit polyclonal antibodies did not show analogous affinities to the present peptides."

Particularly the effect of two-step sintering at different temperatures on microstructure and mechanical properties (compression test) of the scaffolds were analysed. To this end microcomputed tomography and scanning electron microscopy were used as analytical methods. Our experiments showed that the most appropriate conditions of manufacturing were when the scaffolds were heat-treated at 1500 °C for 1 h followed by sintering at 1200 °C for 20 h. Such scaffolds exhibited the highest compressive strength which was correlated with the highest linear density and the lowest size of grains. Moreover, grain size distribution was narrower with predominating fraction of fine grains 10-20 μm in size. Smaller grains and higher linear density sug- gested that in this case densification process prevailed over undesirable process of grain coarsening, which finally resulted in im- proved mechanical properties of the scaffolds.

Here we report the isolation and complete genome sequence of the thermophilic starch-degrading Geobacillus sp. 12AMOR1. The strain 12AMOR1 was isolated from deep-sea hot sediment at the Jan Mayen hydrothermal Vent Site. Geobacillus sp. 12AMOR1 consists of a 3,410,035 bp circular chromosome and a 32,689 bp plasmid with a G + C content of 52 % and 47 %, respectively. The genome comprises 3323 protein-coding genes, 88 tRNA species and 10 rRNA operons. The isolate grows on a suite of sugars, complex polysaccharides and proteinous carbon sources. Accordingly, a versatility of genes encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZy) and peptidases were identified in the genome. Expression, purification and characterization of an enzyme of the glycoside hydrolase family 13 revealed a starch-degrading capacity and high thermal stability with a melting temperature of 76.4 °C. Altogether, the data obtained point to a new isolate from a marine hydrothermal vent with a large bioprospecting potential. "

Volume: 28 Issue: 13 Oct 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17464968/,"A crucial component of research in the field of quantitative structure-activity/property relationships is the identification of molecular descriptors relevant to the activity or property of interest. Descriptors based on the topology of the electron density as formulated in Bader's theory of atoms in molecules are investigated in detail in this work. In a model study, the authors investigate their ability to predict the atomic polar tensor (the gradient of the molecular dipole moment), which contains information on the vibrational intensities in infrared spectroscopy and constitutes a scheme for partitioning the total charge distribution into atomic charges. The atomic polar tensor may therefore be used to investigate whether the descriptors give adequate information on the local electronic structure in the molecule. Both the trace of the atomic polar tensor and for planar molecules its out-of-plane component may be interpreted as definitions of atomic charges suitable for prediction. Hydrogen and carbon atoms in a set of 60 aromatic compounds with various substituents have been studied. Excellent results for prediction of hydrogen and carbon charges have been achieved with cross-validated squared correlation coefficients between predicted and theoretical values varying from 0.92 and 0.977 for the most complex set of substituents when the value, Laplacian, and ellipticity of the electron density in the bond critical points are used as descriptors. The carbon charges defined from the trace of the atomic polar tensor are correlated with its out-of-plane component whereas such relationship is not observed for the hydrogen charges studied in this work."

The only scientifically established adverse health effect of noise is noise-induced hearing loss (NIHL). Besides noise may affect quality of life and cause annoyance and sleep disturbance. The present scientific evidence of potential non-auditory effects of noise on health is quite weak. Whether health promotion works in relation to noise may be reflected by permanent hearing threshold shift development in population studies. Hearing impairment continues to be the most prevalent disability in Western societies. The National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH) still rates noise induced hearing loss among the top ten work-related problems. Recent studies report that employees continue to develop noise induced hearing loss although to a lesser extent than before, in spite of occupational hearing conservation programmes. Besides socio-acusis and leisure noise seem to be an increasing hazard to hearing, also in young children and adolescents. This seems partly related to acute leisure noise exposure (e.g. toy pistols, amplified music). However, population studies increasingly find non-normal high-frequency hearing including the characteristic NIHL-""notch"" around 6 kHz also in subjects who do not report noise exposure incidents or activities. Today 12.5% of US children 6-19 years show a noise-""notch"" in one or both ears (n= 5249, Niskar et al 2001). A Norwegian county audiometry survey on adults >/= 20 years n=51.975) showed mean unscreened thresholds +10 dB at 6 kHz for both genders even or the youngest age group 20-24 years (Borchgrevink et al 2001).

Follow-up information was collected throughout 2001 by linkage to national registries. Only women (n = 86,948) with complete information on alcohol consumption and duration of OC use were included in the present analysis. A total of 1,130 invasive breast cancers were diagnosed during 618,638 person-years of follow-up. Consumption of > or =10.0 g/d alcohol was associated with a breast cancer relative risk (95% confidence interval) of 1.69 (1.32-2.15), consistent with a linear relationship (P for trend < 0.0001). Among alcohol consumers, an excess risk of breast cancer was observed for total duration of OC use only among women who consumed <5 g/d alcohol (P for trend = 0.0009). We observed a negative interaction between duration of OC use and alcohol consumption effects (P for interaction = 0.01). After stratification on menopausal status, the association between high alcohol intake and breast cancer was more prominent among postmenopausal women than among premenopausal women (P for heterogeneity = 0.01). No interaction between alcohol and duration of OC use were significant after stratification on menopausal status. Our findings in conjunction with biological data imply that alcohol and OCs have antagonistic effects on breast cancer risk through a common pathway. Whether the interactive effect differs according to menopausal status remains unclear and needs further investigations."

The ActiReg has two pairs of position and motion sensors connected by cables to a battery-operated storage unit fixed to a waist belt. Each pair of sensors was attached by medical tape to the chest and to the front of the right thigh respectively. The collected data were transferred to a personal computer and processed by a dedicated program ActiCalc. Calculation models for EE with and without HR are presented. The models were based on literature values for the energy costs of different activities and therefore require no calibration experiments. The ActiReg system was validated against doubly labelled water (DLW) and indirect calorimetry. The DLW validation demonstrated that neither EE calculated from ActiReg data alone (EEAR) nor from combined ActiReg and HR data (EEAR-HR) were statistically different from DLW results. The EEAR procedure causes some underestimation of EE >11 MJ corresponding to a PA level >2.0. This underestimation is reduced by the EEAR-HR procedure. The objective recording of the time spent in different body positions and at different levels of PA may be useful in studies of PA in different groups and in studies of whether recommendations for PA are being met. The comparative ease of data collection and calculation should make ActiReg a useful instrument to measure habitual PA level and EE."

Volume: 43 11 15 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29140570/,"Human pluripotent stem cells (hPSCs) hold tremendous promise for regenerative medicine, disease modeling, toxicology screening, and developmental biology. These applications are hindered due to inherent differences in differentiation potential observed among different hPSC lines. This is particularly true for the differentiation of hPSCs toward the endodermal lineage. Several groups have developed methods to screen hPSCs for their endodermal differentiation potential (EP). Particularly notable studies include (i) the use of WNT3A expression as a predictive biomarker, (ii) an embryoid body-based screen, and (iii) a transcriptomics-based approach. We recently developed a rapid screen to access the EP of hPSCs solely based on morphological analysis. The screen takes 4 days to perform and yields results that are easy to interpret. As the screen is based on our recently developed small molecule protocol for hepatocyte like cell (HLC) differentiation of hPSCs, this method is extremely cost-effective compared to the aforementioned approaches. © 2017 by John Wiley & Sons, Inc."

Volume: 68 Aug 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25261764/,"Parkinson's disease is a chronic, progressive neurodegenerative disorder with increased prevalence in the aging population. It is estimated that approximately 1.5 million individuals in the US alone suffer from Parkinson's disease and with the extension of life expectancy this number is expected to rise dramatically within the next twenty-five years. The majority of Parkinson's disease cases are sporadic. But mutations in genes such as α-synuclein, Parkin, PINK1, DJ-1 and LRRK2, have been conclusively associated with both early- and late-onset of the disease. Although the genetics of Parkinson's disease is starting to become unraveled, the interplay between genetic and environmental factors is largely unknown as are the underlying mechanisms that trigger the disease as the brain ages. The risk of Parkinson's disease increases dramatically in individuals over the age of 60 and it is estimated that more than 1% of all seniors have some form of the condition. In this review, we will highlight some of the central proteins associated with Parkinson's disease and how they may be linked to processes and factors associated with age. "

According to the literature, mostly in retrospective studies, laparoscopy might reduce the frequencies of unnecessary appendectomies in 20-30 percent and an accuracy of diagnosis of appendicitis of 95-99 percent. This means that laparoscopy has a sensitivity of 92 percent in diagnosing acute appendicitis, including all cases of mucosal inflammation only. This means, however, that about one in 11 appendicitis is missed and it is still a question as to whether an appendix that looks normal at laparoscopy for acute right iliac fossa pain should be removed, or whether if it is not removed, there is a risk of missing an early case of appendicitis later leading to perforation and peritonitis? Mucosal inflammation obviously can never be determined in the appendix is left in place. However, a summery of available data seems to favour that it is distinctly uncommon that explorative laparoscopy misses any acute appendicitis that requires appendectomy. If there are cases of acute appendicitis not requiring appendectomy can only be known in prospective studies. A Cochran review was published in early 2002 and analysed 45 randomized trials, 39 of which had been carried out in adults, comparing both therapeutic and diagnostic outcomes of patients undergoing open or laparoscopic surgery for suspected appendicitis. Diagnostic outcomes favoured the laparoscopic approach in that both the negative appendectomy rate and ""the frequency of an unestablished diagnosis"" were reduced, most significantly in women in their reproductive years. However, in the conclusion the authors sounded a note of caution about the quality of some of the research data they had analysed, and recommended that more blinded studies be performed. Because there is a belief that laparoscopic appendectomy is less likely to cause intraperitoneal adhesions than open surgery, they also recommended longer follow-up studies to assess the relative incidences of obstruction due to adhesions resulting from the two techniques. Therefore, the conclusion can be drawn that in all equivocal cases laparoscopy is better than laparotomy as the initial step in year 2003. However, there is still a lack of data comparing non-invasive modern techniques such as ultrasonography and CT with laparoscopy, and the value of laparoscopy after the best available ultrasonography or CT."

Volume: 22 Issue: 2 Apr 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17440215/,"Time-dependent variations in clock gene expression have recently been observed in mouse hematopoietic cells, but the activity of these genes in human bone marrow (BM) has so far not been investigated. Since such data can be of considerable clinical interest for monitoring the dynamics in stem/progenitor cells, the authors have studied mRNA expression of the clock genes hPer1 , hPer2, hCry1, hCry2, hBmal1, hRev-erb alpha, and hClock in human hematopoietic CD34-positive (CD34( +)) cells. CD34(+) cells were isolated from the BM samples obtained from 10 healthy men at 6 times over 24 h. In addition, clock gene mRNA expression was analyzed in the whole BM in 3 subjects. Rhythms in serum cortisol, growth hormone, testosterone, and leukocyte counts documented that subjects exhibited standardized circadian patterns. All 7 clock genes were expressed both in CD34(+) cells and the whole BM, with some differences in magnitude between the 2 cell populations. A clear circadian rhythm was shown for hPer1, hPer2, and hCry2 expression in CD34(+) cells and for hPer1 in the whole BM, with maxima from early morning to midday. Similar to mouse hematopoietic cells, h Bmal1 was not oscillating rhythmically. The study demonstrates that clock gene expression in human BM stem/progenitor cells may be developmentally regulated, with strong or weaker circadian profiles as compared to those reported in other mature tissues."

Volume: 107 Feb 15 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25527238/,"The standard analysis approach in neuroimaging genetics studies is the mass-univariate linear modeling (MULM) approach. From a statistical view, however, this approach is disadvantageous, as it is computationally intensive, cannot account for complex multivariate relationships, and has to be corrected for multiple testing. In contrast, multivariate methods offer the opportunity to include combined information from multiple variants to discover meaningful associations between genetic and brain imaging data. We assessed three multivariate techniques, partial least squares correlation (PLSC), sparse canonical correlation analysis (sparse CCA) and Bayesian inter-battery factor analysis (Bayesian IBFA), with respect to their ability to detect multivariate genotype-phenotype associations. Our goal was to systematically compare these three approaches with respect to their performance and to assess their suitability for high-dimensional and multi-collinearly dependent data as is the case in neuroimaging genetics studies. In a series of simulations using both linearly independent and multi-collinear data, we show that sparse CCA and PLSC are suitable even for very high-dimensional collinear imaging data sets. Among those two, the predictive power was higher for sparse CCA when voxel numbers were below 400 times sample size and candidate SNPs were considered. Accordingly, we recommend Sparse CCA for candidate phenotype, candidate SNP studies. When voxel numbers exceeded 500 times sample size, the predictive power was the highest for PLSC. Therefore, PLSC can be considered a promising technique for multivariate modeling of high-dimensional brain-SNP-associations. In contrast, Bayesian IBFA cannot be recommended, since additional post-processing steps were necessary to detect causal relations. To verify the applicability of sparse CCA and PLSC, we applied them to an experimental imaging genetics data set provided for us. Most importantly, application of both methods replicated the findings of this data set. "

Volume: 30 Issue: 1 Pt B Dec 25 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26368670/,"To speed up sedimentation of suspended solids the mining industry often uses flocculent chemicals. In this work we evaluated the cytotoxic and mechanistic effects of Polydadmac, and its basic component Dadmac, on fish cells. Dose-response effects, temperature-dependent effects and impact of Dadmac and Polydadmac on Cu toxicity were studied in Atlantic salmon hepatocytes. We used the xCELLigence system and the MTT test for cytotoxicity assessments, and real-time RT-qPCR to evaluate molecular effects. The results showed a cytotoxic response for Polydadmac but not for Dadmac. Elevated levels of Cu were cytotoxic. Moderately cytotoxic concentrations of Cu (100-1000 μM) induced significant responses on the transcription of a number of genes in the cells, i.e. cuznsod (sod1), cat, mnsod (sod2), nfe2l2, hmox1, mta, casp3b, casp6, bclx, cyp1a, ccs, atp7a, app, mmp13, esr1, ppara, fads2 and ptgs2. A factorial PLS regression model for mnsod transcription showed a synergistic effect between Dadmac and Cu exposure in the cells, indicating an interaction effect between Dadmac and Cu on mitochondrial ROS scavenging. No interaction effects were seen for Polydadmac on Cu toxicity. In conclusion, Polydadmac is cytotoxic at elevated concentrations but appears to have low ability to interfere with Cu toxicity in Atlantic salmon liver cells."

Volume: 69 12 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30056177/,"Dysregulation of neuronal intracellular Ca2+ homeostasis can play a crucial role in many neurotoxic effects, including impaired brain development and behavioral dysfunctions. This study examined 40 suspected neurotoxicants from different chemical classes for their capacity to alter Ca2+ release and uptake from rat cortical microsomes. First, ten suspected neurotoxicants have been tested using a well-established cuvette-based Ca2+ flux assay. Five out of ten compounds (TOCP, endosulfan, PCB-95, chlorpyrifos and BDE-49) showed a significant, concentration-dependent alteration of Ca2+ release and uptake in adult rat cortical microsomes. The original cuvette assay was downscaled and customized to a fast, higher throughput microplate method and the 40 suspected neurotoxicants were screened for their effects on intracellular Ca2+homeostasis. In decreasing order of potency, the 15 test compounds that showed the strongest alteration of Ca2+ levels in adult rat microsomes were TOCP, endosulfan, BDE-49, 6-OH-BDE-47, PCB-95, permethrin, alpha-cypermethrin, chlorpyrifos, bioallethrin, cypermethrin, RDP, DEHP, DBP, BDE-47, and PFOS. Results from co-exposure experiments with selective inhibitors suggested that for some compounds Ca2+ releasing effects could be attributed to RyR activation (PFOS, DBP, and DEHP) or to SERCA inhibition (a potential novel mechanism of action for all four tested pyrethroid insecticides). The effects of the two most potent compounds, endosulfan and TOCP, were not blocked by any of the inhibitors tested, indicating other possible mechanism of action. For all other potent test compounds, a combined effect on RyR, IP3R, and/or SERCA has been observed. PFOS and 6-OH-BDE-47 caused increased Ca2+ release from adult but not from neonatal rat brain microsomes, indicating age-dependent difference in susceptibility to these test compounds. The current study suggests that the neurotoxic potential of compounds belonging to different chemical classes could partly be attributed to the effects on intracellular Ca2+ release and uptake. Although further validation is required, the downscaled method developed in this study presents technical advance that could be used for the future screening of suspected intracellular Ca2+ disruptors."

Oct 29 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30373468/,"Several gastrointestinal diseases show a sex imbalance, although the underlying (patho)physiological mechanisms behind this are not well understood. The gut microbiome may be involved in this process, forming a complex interaction with host immune system, sex hormones, medication and other environmental factors. Here we performed sex-specific analyses of fecal microbiota composition in 1135 individuals from a population-based cohort. The overall gut microbiome composition of females and males was significantly different (p = 0.001), with females showing a greater microbial diversity (p = 0.009). After correcting for the effects of intrinsic factors, smoking, diet and medications, female hormonal factors such as the use of oral contraceptives and undergoing an ovariectomy were associated with microbial species and pathways. Females had a higher richness of antibiotic-resistance genes, with the most notable being resistance to the lincosamide nucleotidyltransferase (LNU) gene family. The higher abundance of resistance genes is consistent with the greater prescription of the Macrolide-Lincosamide-Streptogramin classes of antibiotics to females. Furthermore, we observed an increased resistance to aminoglycosides in females with self-reported irritable bowel syndrome. These results throw light upon the effects of common medications that are differentially prescribed between sexes and highlight the importance of sex-specific analysis when studying the gut microbiome and resistome."

Their number is rapidly growing and more than 3 % of the adult populations in Western countries have survived cancer for 5 years or more. Cancer survivors are at increased risk for a variety of late effects after treatment, some life-threatening such as secondary cancer and cardiac diseases, others might negatively impact on their daily functioning and quality of life. The latter might include fatigue, anxiety disorders and difficulties returning to work while depression does not seem to be more common among survivors than in the general population. Still, the majority of survivors regain their health and social functioning. The field of cancer survivorship research has been rapidly growing. Models for follow-up care of cancer survivors have been proposed, but how to best integrate the knowledge of the field into clinical practice with adequate follow-up of cancer survivors at risk for developing late effects is still an unsolved question.

Cognitive assessment comprised neuropsychological tests of executive function, working memory, attention, and memory. Dexterity assessment included evaluation of movement times and kinematics during performance of unimanual and bimanual tasks of the Purdue Pegboard Test. Cognitive and dexterity group differences were established. Thereafter, regression analyses showed that executive function best predicted movement times and to some extent path lengths for the left hand in the older group. No gender differences were found in older participants. The findings confirm the involvement of executive function in manual dexterity in aging and suggest that movement times and path length may be useful parameters to assess the cognition-dexterity association in older adults."

A further objective was to assess related factors such as exposure, instrument category, and the preventive effect of hearing protection. The study was a cross-sectional survey of rock musicians selected at random from a defined cohort of musicians. A random control group was included for comparison. We recruited 111 active musicians from the Oslo region, and a control group of 40 nonmusicians from the student population at the University of TromsØ. The subjects were investigated using clinical examination, pure tone audiometry, tympanometry, and a questionnaire. We observed a hearing loss in 37.8% of the rock musicians. Significantly poorer hearing thresholds were seen at most pure-tone frequencies in musicians than controls, with the most pronounced threshold shift at 6 kHz. The use of hearing protection, in particular custom-fitted earplugs, has a preventive effect but a minority of rock musicians apply them consistently. The degree of musical performance exposure was inversely related to the degree of hearing loss in our sample. Bass and guitar players had higher hearing thresholds than vocalists. We observed a 20% prevalence of chronic tinnitus but none of the affected musicians had severe tinnitus symptomatology. There was no statistical association between permanent tinnitus and hearing loss in our sample. We observed an increased prevalence of hearing loss and tinnitus in our sample of Norwegian rock musicians but the causal relationship between musical exposure and hearing loss or tinnitus is ambiguous. We recommend the use of hearing protection in rock musicians. "

Although genetic risk factors for COPD have been identified, much of the heritability remains unexplained. Sex-based genetic association studies may uncover additional COPD genetic risk factors. We studied current and former smokers from COPD case-control cohorts (COPDGene non-Hispanic whites and African Americans, Evaluation of COPD Longitudinally to Identify Predictive Surrogate End-Points, and Genetics of Chronic Obstructive Lung Disease). COPD was defined as post-bronchodilator forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced vital capacity less than 0.70 and forced expiratory volume in 1 second percent predicted less than 80. Testing was performed across all cohorts and combined in a meta-analysis adjusted for age, pack-years, and genetic ancestry. We first performed genome-wide single-nucleotide polymorphism (SNP)-by-sex interaction testing on the outcome of COPD affection status. We performed sex-stratified association testing for SNPs with interaction P less than 10-6. We examined over 8 million SNPs in four populations, including 6,260 subjects with COPD (40.6% female) and 5,269 smoking control subjects (47.3% female). The SNP rs9615358 in the cadherin gene CELSR1 approached genome-wide significance for an interaction with sex (P = 1.24 × 10-7). In the sex-stratified meta-analysis, this SNP was associated with COPD among females (odds ratio, 1.37 [95% confidence interval, 1.25-1.49]; P = 3.32 × 10-7) but not males (odds ratio, 0.90 [95% confidence interval, 0.79-1.01]; P = 0.06). CELSR1 is involved in fetal lung development. In a human fetal lung tissue dataset, we observed greater CELSR1 expression in female compared with male samples. This SNP-by-sex genome-wide association analysis identified the fetal lung development gene, CELSR1, as a potential sex-specific risk factor for COPD. Identifying sex-specific genetic risk factors may reveal new insights into sexually dimorphic features of COPD."

Here, the adsorption of the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon phenanthrene (70-735 μg/L) to five types of CNTs exhibiting different physical and chemical properties was studied. The CNTs were dispersed in the presence of natural organic matter (nominally 20 mg/L) in order to increase the environmental relevance of the study. Furthermore, the bioavailability and toxicity of phenanthrene to Daphnia magna in the absence and presence of dispersed CNTs was investigated. Both CNT dispersion and adsorption of phenanthrene appeared to be influenced by CNT physical properties (diameter and specific surface area). However, dispersion and phenanthrene adsorption was not influenced by CNT surface chemical properties (surface oxygen content), under the conditions tested. Based on nominal phenanthrene concentrations, a reduction in toxicity to D. magna was observed during coexposure to phenanthrene and two types of CNTs, while for the others, no influence on phenanthrene toxicity was observed. Based on freely dissolved concentrations, however, an increased toxicity was observed in the presence of all CNTs, indicating bioavailability of CNT-adsorbed phenanthrene to D. magna."

Volume: 24 Issue: 1 Feb 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10709855/,"Preeclampsia develops as a consequence of an exceptionally complex interaction between a multiplicity of factors that originate in 2 genetically different individuals (the mother and the fetus). Oxidative stress/oxidative lipid derivatives may represent one group of such factors. The evidence for a role of oxidative stress/oxidative lipid derivatives in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia may be summarized as follows: In women with established preeclampsia there is good evidence of increased oxidative stress/oxidative lipid derivatives in the decidual-placental tissues. Likewise, in the systemic circulation of women with established preeclampsia most of the studies although not all, indicate elevated levels of oxidative lipid derivatives and reduced anti-oxidative capacity. Because almost all studies on the role of oxidative stress in the pathogenesis of preeclampsia have been among women with established preeclampsia, it remains uncertain whether enhanced oxidative stress is present before clinical signs of preeclampsia develops. One controlled randomized study in which antioxidants were used to treat severe preeclampsia showed nonsignificant differences in clinical outcomes in favor of antioxidants. Controlled studies on the effectiveness of antioxidants in preventing preeclampsia are lacking.

Volume: 55 Issue: 4 Jul 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/7569731/,"The serum levels of Lp(a) lipoprotein (Lp(a)) were determined preoperatively in 601 patients with coronary artery disease, undergoing bypass operations. Compared with a reference group of 99 apparently healthy individuals, the Lp(a) levels were higher in the patient group (7.7 mg dl-1 vs. 5.1 mg dl-1, p = 0.012). In the patient group, there was a weak, but significant negative correlation between the Lp(a) levels and age (r = -0.10, p = 0.017), and in both groups the women had higher Lp(a) levels than the men. In the patients we found no significant correlations between Lp(a) and other serum lipids or lipoproteins, nor between Lp(a) and variables in the fibrinolytic system. We investigated the long-term effects of supplementation with n-3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n-3 PUFAs) on the Lp(a) concentrations. Postoperatively, in a randomized fashion, 280 of the patients received 4 g of an n-3 PUFA concentrate (containing > 85% of long-chain n-3 PUFAs) per day, whereas 269 patients comprised the control group. The fatty acids in serum phospholipids were monitored, and a significant increase in the phospholipid n-3 fatty acids was noted in the n-3 PUFA group, as opposed to the virtually unchanged amounts in the control group. The Lp(a) levels were determined again after 6 months, and, compared with the control group, n-3 PUFA supplementation had no overall effect on the serum Lp(a) levels."
304,Trends in incidence of testicular cancer in Norway 1955-1992.,8562163,"European journal of cancer (Oxford, England : 1990). Volume: 31A Issue: 12 Nov 1995",1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8562163/,"The aim of this study was to explore the incidence of testicular cancer (TC) in Norway, and thereby to increase the understanding of aetiological factors. From 1995 to 1992, a total number of 3927 TC cases were recorded in Norway, of which 51% were seminomas, 45% non-seminomas and 4% other and unspecified types. The age-standardised incidence rate increased from 2.7 to 8.5 per 100,000. The age-specific incidence rate increased in all age groups, but was most marked in the younger population. The significance of birth cohort as a risk factor for development of TC was confirmed. The incidence by birth cohorts from 1916 to 1970 showed an increase by later birth cohorts during the whole period, with the exception of a marked fall for the cohort born during the Second World War. The largest increase occurred after the war. We conclude that environmental factors acting very early in life are of significance in the development of TC."

This study adds a qualitative and inner perspective from the families of children suffering from asthma. The aim was to illuminate the influence of an asthma education program (AEP) for parents. The study sample consisted of nine parents of five children with moderate to severe asthma in the 2-6 years age group. Data were collected by interviews and qualitative analyses were used. The main findings were that the parents experienced an increased understanding of their child's experience of asthma after having participated in the program. Three themes were revealed: sharing experiences, accepting the illness, and partnership building. In conclusion, the parents in the study expressed that they promote increased self-understanding by meeting other parents in groups."

BSE was performed at least once a month in 30.6% of the cases, and 54.6% had a Pap smear test once every third year at least. BSE was never practised among 19.2% of the physicians, the main reasons being that they forgot it, or that they stated that they were in a low risk group or had no symptoms of disease. 16.2% had never had routine Pap smears, and these physicians claimed that they were in a low risk group or had no symptoms of disease, that they had a problem in finding a physician to attend, or that they forgot to take the test. A subgroup of 135 physicians aged 35-49 years was compared with 738 women with higher university education included from a nation-wide representative sample of the general population of Norway. A significantly higher percentage of physicians practised BSE monthly or more often compared with other university educated women. However, a significantly lower percentage of the physicians had Pap smear tests every third year or more frequently. The positive association between being a physician and practising BSE, and the negative association between being a physician and having Pap smear tests, remained after controlling for potential confounders in multivariate analyses."

Volume: 11 Issue: 8 Aug 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17665978/,"Mitochondria have major roles in bioenergetics and vital signalling of the mammalian cell. Consequently, these organelles have been implicated in the process of carcinogenesis, which includes alterations of cellular metabolism and cell death pathways. Multiple molecular routes of malignant transformation appear to result in the common ability of many tumours to take up large amounts of glucose. This metabolic twist has been explained by phenomena such as aerobic glycolysis and impaired mitochondrial function, and is linked to tumour growth potential via major cellular signalling pathways. This paper reviews the literature on central mechanisms through which energy metabolism merges with growth, proliferation and death signalling, which tend to include mitochondria at some level. These processes can potentially be targeted by pharmacological agents for therapeutic and chemosensitising purposes."

Medical history was obtained from female pSS patients, and sex- and age-matched non-SS patients with sicca symptoms (non-SS sicca controls) as well as healthy subjects without sicca complaints (healthy controls). Oral (Summated Xerostomia Inventory, SXI) and ocular (McMonnies Dry Eye questionnaire, MDEIS, and Ocular Surface Disease Index, OSDI) subjective complaints were recorded. Objective findings including clinical oral dryness scores (CODS), unstimulated and stimulated saliva secretion rates (UWS/SWS), Schirmer I test, tear osmolarity, tear film break-up time (TFBUT), and ocular surface staining (OSS) were determined. The pSS and non-SS sicca controls were extensively troubled by subjective dryness, while the pSS group had higher CODS, significantly lower saliva and tear secretion, shorter TFBUT and higher OSS than both control groups. Furthermore, candida counts were significantly higher in the pSS patients. In the pSS group, subjective oral dryness significantly correlated with ocular dryness (MDEIS: r = 0.5, OSDI: r = 0.413) and SWS was significantly correlated with Schirmer I (r = 0.419). The findings imply that interdisciplinary subjective and objective evaluation of patients with xerostomia and xerophthalmia not only have implications for patient care, but also may guide clinicians in differentiating between pSS and non-SS sicca patients."

Oxidation of herring lipids in emulsions and liposomes was followed in in vitro digestion models containing authentic human gastric juice, and compared to models containing hydrochloric acid solution. Peroxide value, concentration of thiobarbituric acid reactive substances and oxygen uptake rate increased in all the models during 2.5 h incubation at pH 4 and 37 °C in darkness. The markers showed no difference between oxidation in gastric juice and hydrochloric acid solution. Gastric juice reduced the prooxidant activity of iron ions measured as oxygen uptake rate, but did not reduce the activity of methemoglobin. Berry juice, green tea, red wine, and caffeic acid reduced oxygen uptake in the acidic environments while coffee, ascorbic acid and orange juice increased oxidation. Beverages accompanying foods containing marine lipids will therefore affect the course of post-prandial lipid oxidation."

Volume: 144 Issue: 4 Dec 1996,1996,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8978074/,"A new maximum likelihood method to simultaneously estimate the parameters of any migration pattern from gene frequencies in stochastic equilibrium is developed, based on a model of multivariate genetic drift in a subdivided population. Motivated by simulations of this process in the simplified case of two subpopulations, problems related to the nuisance parameter q, the equilibrium gene frequency, are eliminated by conditioning on the observed mean gene frequency. The covariance matrix of this conditional distribution is calculated by constructing an abstract process that mimics the behavior of the original process in the subspace of interest. The approximation holds as long as there is limited differentiation between subpopulations. The bias and variance of estimates of long-range and short-range migration in a finite stepping stone model are evaluated by fitting the model to simulated data with known values of the parameters. Possible ecological extensions of the model are discussed."

The two distinct clusters recognized among the M. lacunata strains apparently corresponded to the species previously designated M. lacunata and M. liquefaciens. Distinction of the four entities was improved by hybridization with polymerase chain reaction products of nonconserved parts of pilin genes as DNA probes. With these polymerase chain reaction probes, new isolates of M. nonliquefaciens, M. lacunata, M. liquefaciens, and M. bovis can be identified easily by hybridization."
314,Feeding type and development drive the ingestion of microplastics by freshwater invertebrates.,29208925,Scientific reports. Volume: 7 Issue: 1 Dec 05 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29208925/,"Microscopic plastic items (microplastics) are ubiquitously present in aquatic ecosystems. With decreasing size their availability and potential to accumulate throughout food webs increase. However, little is known on the uptake of microplastics by freshwater invertebrates. To address this, we exposed species with different feeding strategies to 1, 10 and 90 µm fluorescent polystyrene spheres (3-3 000 particles mL-1). Additionally, we investigated how developmental stages and a co-exposure to natural particles (e.g., food) modulate microplastic ingestion. All species ingested microplastics in a concentration-dependent manner with Daphnia magna consuming up to 6 180 particles h-1, followed by Chironomus riparius (226 particles h-1), Physella acuta (118 particles h-1), Gammarus pulex (10 particles h-1) and Lumbriculus variegatus (8 particles h-1). D. magna did not ingest 90 µm microplastics whereas the other species preferred larger microplastics over 1 µm in size. In C. riparius and D. magna, size preference depended on the life stage with larger specimens ingesting more and larger microplastics. The presence of natural particles generally reduced the microplastics uptake. Our results demonstrate that freshwater invertebrates have the capacity to ingest microplastics. However, the quantity of uptake depends on their feeding type and morphology as well as on the availability of microplastics."

The objective of the current study was to identify risk factors for developing tuberculosis following recent infection, in order to better target interventions. Strains from 861 culture-positive cases, diagnosed in Norway in 1994-1999, were analysed by use of restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP). A cluster was defined as two or more isolates with identical RFLP patterns. Risk factors for being part of a cluster were identified by univariate and multivariate analysis. A total of 134 patients were part of a cluster. These constituted 5% Asian-born, 18% Norwegian-born, 24% European-born and 29% African-born patients. Four independent risk factors for being part of a cluster were identified: being born in Norway, being of young age, being infected with an isoniazid-resistant strain and being infected with a multidrug-resistant strain. Transmission of tuberculosis may be further reduced by improving case management, contact tracing, preventive treatment, screening of immigrants and access to health services for the foreign-born population."

Volume: 6 Issue: 7 Jun 12 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923322/,"Transposable elements (TEs) are ubiquitous inhabitants of eukaryotic genomes and their proliferation and dispersal shape genome architectures and diversity. Nevertheless, TE dynamics are often explored for one species at a time and are rarely considered in ecological contexts. Recent work with plant pathogens suggests a link between symbiosis and TE abundance. The genomes of pathogenic fungi appear to house an increased abundance of TEs, and TEs are frequently associated with the genes involved in symbiosis. To investigate whether this pattern is general, and relevant to mutualistic plant-fungal symbioses, we sequenced the genomes of related asymbiotic (AS) and ectomycorrhizal (ECM) Amanita fungi. Using methods developed to interrogate both assembled and unassembled sequences, we characterized and quantified TEs across three AS and three ECM species, including the AS outgroup Volvariella volvacea. The ECM genomes are characterized by abundant numbers of TEs, an especially prominent feature of unassembled sequencing libraries. Increased TE activity in ECM species is also supported by phylogenetic analysis of the three most abundant TE superfamilies; phylogenies revealed many radiations within contemporary ECM species. However, the AS species Amanita thiersii also houses extensive amplifications of elements, highlighting the influence of additional evolutionary parameters on TE abundance. Our analyses provide further evidence for a link between symbiotic associations among plants and fungi, and increased TE activity, while highlighting the importance individual species' natural histories may have in shaping genome architecture.

The E. coli strains that cause diarrhoeal illness are categorised into pathogenicity groups based on virulence properties, mechanisms of pathogenicity, clinical symptoms and serology. The five main categories include enterotoxinogenic E. coli (ETEC), enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC), enteroaggregative E. coli (EAggEC), enteroinvasive E. coli (EIEC) and Shiga (Vero) toxin-producing E. coli (STEC/VTEC). From a zoonotic point of view, STEC is the only E. coli pathogenicity group of major interest, as the shiga toxin-producing strains are able to cause severe disease in humans when being transmitted through the food chain from their animal reservoirs. The focus of this manuscript is therefore on STEC; pathogenicity factors, disease, the reservoirs and on-farm ecology, transmission into the food chain, growth and survival in food and in the environment, and the shiga toxin-encoding bacteriophages."

Three related acyclic pentapeptides Boc-Ser(All)-Xaa1-Val-Ser(All)-Gly-OMe (Xaa1 = Val, Aib; Boc = tert-butoxycarbonyl; All = allyl) and Boc-Ser(Bn)-Val-Val-Gly-Gly-OMe (Bn = benzyl) and two acyclic heptapeptides Boc-Pro-Pro-Ser(All)-Val-Val-Ser(All)-Gly-OMe and Boc-Pro-Pro-Ser(Bn)-Val-Val-Gly-Gly-OMe were also prepared. NMR, CD and IR data provided evidence that the peptides can access a 3(10) helical structure in apolar solvents and pointed to a significant stabilising effect of the olefinic bridge on helicity in an aqueous environment. Thus we could demonstrate the viability of using ring closing olefin metathesis to stabilise short protein segments in the helical conformation that they adopt in their native protein environment. Our approach provides access to a set of peptides with potential binding affinity for AQP4."

After a thorough medical examination and consent in writing by the responsible guardian, a baseline sum score for frequency and seriousness of drooling was established over a 2 week period in addition to data on shifts of handkerchiefs, urination, defecation and observation of behaviour. Glycopyrrolate (1 mg) tablets were then administered, starting with one tablet daily the third week and increasing the daily dose by one tablet per week until a maximum of four tablets during week six and 4 days of week seven when the daily dose was reduced to two tablets for 3 days. For the four weeks 8-11 three tablets were given daily. In week 12 the dose was reduced to two tablets and for the weeks 13-15 no tablets of glycopyrrolate were given. 3. For as long as the patient received three to four tablets of glycopyrrolate daily, drooling was markedly reduced and handkerchiefs were not necessary on some days. After the tablets were withdrawn drooling increased to approximately the same level as it was before treatment. No adverse medical, psychological, or social effects were observed. 4. For shorter periods, glycopyrrolate can be given in controlled doses provided that an adequate medical assessment has been undertaken."

Volume: 135 Jan 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24406253/,"Cockayne Syndrome is a segmental premature aging syndrome, which can be caused by loss of function of the CSB protein. CSB is essential for genome maintenance and has numerous interaction partners with established roles in different DNA repair pathways including transcription coupled nucleotide excision repair and base excision repair. Here, we describe a new interaction partner for CSB, the DNA glycosylase NEIL2. Using both cell extracts and recombinant proteins, CSB and NEIL2 were found to physically interact independently of DNA. We further found that CSB is able to stimulate NEIL2 glycosylase activity on a 5-hydroxyl uracil lesion in a DNA bubble structure substrate in vitro. A novel 4,6-diamino-5-formamidopyrimidine (FapyA) specific incision activity of NEIL2 was also stimulated by CSB. To further elucidate the biological role of the interaction, immunofluorescence studies were performed, showing an increase in cytoplasmic CSB and NEIL2 co-localization after oxidative stress. Additionally, stalling of the progression of the transcription bubble with α-amanitin resulted in increased co-localization of CSB and NEIL2. Finally, CSB knockdown resulted in reduced incision of 8-hydroxyguanine in a DNA bubble structure using whole cell extracts. Taken together, our data supports a biological role for CSB and NEIL2 in transcription associated base excision repair. "

Volume: 25 Issue: 17 Apr 20 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16331257/,"Cyclin D3 has been shown to play a major role in the regulation of cell cycle progression in lymphocytes. It is therefore important to understand the mechanisms involved in the regulation of this protein. We have previously shown that both basal and cAMP-induced degradation of cyclin D3 in Reh cells is dependent on Thr-283 phosphorylation by glycogen synthase kinase-3beta (GSK-3beta). We now provide evidence of an alternative mechanism being involved in the regulation of cyclin D3 degradation. Treatment of lymphoid cells with okadaic acid (OA), an inhibitor of protein phosphatases 1 and 2A (PP1 and PP2A), induces rapid phosphorylation and proteasomal degradation of cyclin D3. This degradation is not inhibited by the GSK-3beta inhibitors lithium or Kenpaullone, or by substitution of Thr-283 with Ala on cyclin D3, indicating that cyclin D3 can be degraded independently of Thr-283 phosphorylation and GSK-3beta activity. Interestingly, in vitro experiments revealed that PP1, but not PP2A, was able to dephosphorylate cyclin D3 efficiently, and PP1 was found to associate with His-tagged cyclin D3. These results support the hypothesis that PP1 constitutively keeps cyclin D3 in a stable, dephosphorylated state, and that treatment of cells with OA leads to phosphorylation and degradation of cyclin D3 through inhibition of PP1."

Volume: 112 Issue: 16 Apr 24 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18341308/,"Following exposure to X-irradiation at low temperatures, the main reactions taking place in single crystals of cytosine monohydrate doped with minute amounts of 2-thiocytosine are hole transfer (HT) from the electron-loss centers to the dopant and recombination of oxidation and reduction products, assumedly by electron transfer. A huge deuterium kinetic isotope effect (KIE; >102-103) at 100 K, together with the kinetic curves obtained and density functional theory (DFT) calculations of equilibrium energy changes, indicates that these reactions proceed through a concerted proton-coupled electron/hole transfer where the proton transfer occurs between hydrogen-bonded cytosine molecules. The temperature dependence of these reaction rates between 10 and 150 K in normal and partially deuterated samples was investigated by monitoring the growth and decay of the various radical species over time using electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectroscopy. By assuming a random distribution of the hole donors and acceptors in the crystals, the data are consistent with an exponential distance-dependent rate, giving a distance decay constant (beta) around 1 A-1 for the HT, which indicates that a long-range single-step superexchange mechanism mediates the charge transfer. The reactions undergo a transition from a slow, weakly temperature-dependent rate to an Arrhenius-type rate at 40-50 K, presumably being activated by excitation of low-frequency intermolecular vibrations that couple to the process. Below this transition temperature, the transfer probability might be dominated by temperature-independent nuclear tunneling. A similar beta value in both temperature regions suggests that hopping is not activated."

Volume: 360 2007",2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17172722/,"The identification and validation of disease-causing target genes is an essential first step in drug discovery and development. Genomics and proteomics technologies have already begun to uncover novel functional pathways and therapeutic targets in several human diseases such as cancers and autoimmunity. Also, bioinformatics approaches have highlighted several key targets and functional networks. In contrast to gene-profiling approaches, phenotype-oriented target identification allows direct link between the genetic alterations and a disease phenotype. Therefore, identified genes are more likely to be a cause rather than a consequence of the disease. Once a gene target or a mechanistic pathway is identified, the next step is to demonstrate that it does play a critical role in disease initiation, perpetuation, or both. A range of strategies exists for modulating gene expression in vitro and in vivo. These strategies include the use of antibodies, negative dominant controls, antisense oligonucleotides, ribozymes, and small-interfering RNAs. In contrast to in vitro assays, mouse reverse genetics such as knockout phenotypes has become a powerful approach for deciphering gene function and target validation in the context of mammalian physiology. In addition to disease-causing genes, the identification of antigens that stimulate both arms of the immune system is the major goal for effective vaccine development. The hope is that target discovery and validation processes will concurrently identify and validate therapeutic targets for drug intervention in human diseases."

We have studied 341 consecutive AID children born of 261 women during a 13-year period. Data from hospital archives were compared with information from the National Register of Norway. The parameters studied included age-relations of parents and offspring, sex- and age-relations between siblings as well as the divorce rate in AID families. Median maternal age at birth of the first AID child was 30 years. Forty-three percent of AID children were born in families that already had children or that later obtained an additional child; the majority of these siblings were conceived by AID. Mean age difference between the closest related AID siblings was three years. Six of the 261 AID families were split by divorce during the study period. The results only reflect such information as can currently be obtained with maintenance of the promise of secrecy."

A parallel guideline committee (BMJ Rapid Recommendation) provided input on the design and interpretation of the systematic review, including selection of outcomes important to patients. The GRADE system was used to assess the quality of evidence.Results 26 randomized controlled trials with a median sample size of 30 (range 8-501) were included. The most trustworthy evidence came from four trials at low risk of bias that included patients with tibia or clavicle fractures. Compared with control, LIPUS did not reduce time to return to work (percentage difference: 2.7% later with LIPUS, 95% confidence interval 7.7% earlier to 14.3% later; moderate certainty) or the number of subsequent operations (risk ratio 0.80, 95% confidence interval 0.55 to 1.16; moderate certainty). For pain, days to weight bearing, and radiographic healing, effects varied substantially among studies. For all three outcomes, trials at low risk of bias failed to show a benefit with LIPUS, while trials at high risk of bias suggested a benefit (interaction P<0.001). When only trials at low risk of bias trials were considered, LIPUS did not reduce days to weight bearing (4.8% later, 4.0% earlier to 14.4% later; high certainty), pain at four to six weeks (mean difference on 0-100 visual analogue scale: 0.93 lower, 2.51 lower to 0.64 higher; high certainty), and days to radiographic healing (1.7% earlier, 11.2% earlier to 8.8% later; moderate certainty).Conclusions Based on moderate to high quality evidence from studies in patients with fresh fracture, LIPUS does not improve outcomes important to patients and probably has no effect on radiographic bone healing. The applicability to other types of fracture or osteotomy is open to debate.Systematic review registration PROSPERO CRD42016050965."

Volume: 18 Issue: 10 Sep 27 2018",2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30262773/,"Amidst the rapid development of the fifth generation (5G) networks, Internet of Things (IoT) is considered as one of the most important part of 5G next generation networks as it can support massive object communications. These massive object communications in the context of IoT is expected to consume a huge power. Furthermore, IoT sensors or devices are rather power constrained and are mostly battery operated. Therefore, energy efficiency of such network of IoT devices is a major concern. On the other hand, energy harvesting (EH) is an emerging paradigm that allows the wireless nodes to recharge themselves through radio frequency (RF) signals directed to them from the source node and then relaying or transmitting the information. Although a myriad of works have been carried out in the literature for EH, the vast majority of those works only consider RF EH at the relay node and successfully transmitting the source node data. Those approaches do not consider the data transmission of the relay node that may be an energy deprived IoT node which needs to transmit its own data along with the source node data to their respective destination nodes. Therefore, in this paper, we envisioned a RF EH and information transmission system based on time switching (TS) relaying, power splitting (PS) relaying and non-orthogonal multiple access (NOMA) which is suitable for wireless powered IoT relay systems. A source node information data is relayed through power constrained IoT relay node I o T R that first harvests the energy from source node RF signal using either TS and PS relaying protocol and then transmits the source node information along with its information using NOMA protocol to the respective destination nodes. Considering NOMA as a transmission protocol, we have mathematically derived analytical expressions for TS and PS relaying protocol for our proposed system. We have also formulated an algorithm to find out optimal TS and PS factor that maximizes the sum-throughput for our proposed system. Our proposed system analytical results for TS and PS protocol are validated by the simulation results."

Volume: 12 Issue: 5 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28467432/,"Mucosal immunity is important for the protection against a wide variety of pathogens. Traditional vaccines administered via parenteral routes induce strong systemic immunity, but they often fail to generate mucosal IgA. In contrast, bacteria-based vaccines comprise an appealing strategy for antigen delivery to mucosal sites. Vaginal infection with Chlamydia trachomatis can develop into upper genital tract infections that can lead to infertility. Therefore, the development of an effective vaccine against Chlamydia is a high priority. In the present study, we have explored the use of a common lactic acid bacterium, Lactobacillus plantarum, as a vector for delivery of a C. trachomatis antigen to mucosal sites. The antigen, referred as Hirep2 (H2), was anchored to the surface of L. plantarum cells using an N-terminal lipoprotein anchor. After characterization, the constructed strain was used as an immunogenic agent in mice. We explored a heterologous prime-boost strategy, consisting of subcutaneous priming with soluble H2 antigen co-administered with CAF01 adjuvant, followed by an intranasal boost with H2-displaying L. plantarum. The results show that, when used as a booster, the recombinant L. plantarum strain was able to evoke cellular responses. Most importantly, booster immunization with the Lactobacillus-based vaccine induced generation of antigen-specific IgA in the vaginal cavity."

Here, we report the integration of an expression cassette based on the Acinetobacter sp. chnB promoter and its cognate positive regulator chnR gene into a replicon derived from the broad-host-range plasmid RK2. Cyclohexanone was found to be the most efficient inducer of this system in Escherichia coli, using firefly luciferase as a reporter.

343,Initial evaluation of (227)Th-p-benzyl-DOTA-rituximab for low-dose rate alpha-particle radioimmunotherapy.,16546683,Nuclear medicine and biology. Volume: 33 Issue: 2 Feb 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16546683/,"Radioimmunotherapy has proven clinically effective in patients with non-Hodgkin's lymphoma. Radioimmunotherapy trials have so far been performed with beta-emitting isotopes. In contrast to beta-emitters, the shorter range and high linear energy transfer (LET) of alpha particles allow for more efficient and selective killing of individually targeted tumor cells. However, there are several obstacles to the use of alpha-particle immunotherapy, including problems with chelation chemistry and nontarget tissue toxicity. The alpha-emitting radioimmunoconjugate (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab is a new potential anti-lymphoma agent that might overcome some of these difficulties. The present study explores the immunoreactivity, in vivo stability and biodistribution, as well as the effect on in vitro cell growth, of this novel radioimmunoconjugate. To evaluate in vivo stability, uptake in balb/c mice of the alpha-particle-emitting nuclide (227)Th alone, the chelated form, (227)Th-p-nitrobenzyl-DOTA and the radioimmunoconjugate (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab was compared in a range of organs at increasing time points after injection. The immunoreactive fraction of (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab was 56-65%. During the 28 days after injection of radioimmunoconjugate only, very modest amounts of the (227)Th had detached from DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab, indicating a relevant stability in vivo. The half-life of (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab in blood was 7.4 days. Incubation of lymphoma cells with (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab resulted in a significant antigen-dependent inhibition of cell growth. The data presented here warrant further studies of (227)Th-DOTA-p-benzyl-rituximab."

This is the case for the Emperor penguin Aptenodytes forsteri, a flagship Antarctic species that may be at high risk continent-wide before 2100. Here, using genome-wide data from the whole Antarctic continent, we reveal that this top-predator is organized as one single global population with a shared demography since the late Quaternary. We refute the view of the local population as a relevant demographic unit, and highlight that (i) robust extinction risk estimations are only possible by including dispersal rates and (ii) colony-scaled population size is rather indicative of local stochastic events, whereas the species' response to global environmental change is likely to follow a shared evolutionary trajectory."

Volume: 313 Issue: 8 May 01 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17382318/,"The Cbl- and ubiquitin-interacting protein T-cell ubiquitin ligand (TULA) has been demonstrated to inhibit endocytosis and downregulation of ligand-activated EGF receptor (EGFR) by impairing Cbl-induced ubiquitination. We presently report that TULA additionally inhibited clathrin-dependent endocytosis in general, as both uptake of transferrin (Tf) and low-density lipoprotein (LDL) was inhibited. Additionally, endocytosis of the raft proteins CD59 and major histocompatibility complex class I (MHC-I), which we demonstrate were mainly endocytosed clathrin-independently, but dynamin-dependently, was blocked in cells overexpressing TULA. By contrast, the uptake of ricin, which is mainly endocytosed clathrin- and dynamin-independently, was not affected by overexpressed TULA. Consistently, TULA and dynamin co-immunoprecipitated and colocalized intracellularly, and upon overexpression of dynamin the TULA-mediated inhibitory effect on endocytosis of Tf, LDL, CD59 and MHC-I was counteracted. Overexpressed dynamin did not restore ubiquitination of the EGFR, and consistently dynamin did not rescue endocytosis of the EGFR in cells overexpressing TULA. We conclude that TULA inhibits both clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent endocytic pathways by functionally sequestering dynamin via the SH3 domain of TULA binding proline-rich sequences in dynamin."

Volume: 8 Issue: 3 Sep 12 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30213115/,"Dense metal membranes that are based on palladium (Pd) are promising for hydrogen separation and production due to their high selectivity and permeability. Optimization of alloy composition has normally focused on bulk properties, but there is growing evidence that grain boundaries (GBs) play a crucial role in the overall performance of membranes. The present study provides parameters and analyses of GBs in the ternary Pd-Ag-Cu system, based on first-principles electronic structure calculations. The segregation tendency of Cu, Ag, and vacancies towards 12 different coherent ∑ GBs in Pd was quantified using three different procedures for relaxation of supercell lattice constants, representing the outer bounds of infinitely elastic and stiff lattice around the GBs. This demonstrated a clear linear correlation between the excess volume and the GB energy when volume relaxation was allowed for. The point defects were attracted by most of the GBs that were investigated. Realistic atomic-scale models of binary Pd-Cu and ternary Pd-Cu-Ag alloys were created for the ∑5(210) boundary, in which the strong GB segregation tendency was affirmed. This is a starting point for more targeted engineering of alloys and grain structure in dense metal membranes and related systems."

The model explains how vortices are attracted to such walls, and excellent quantitative agreement is obtained for the resulting peaked flux profile determined experimentally in NbSe(2) using high-resolution magneto-optical imaging of vortices. In particular, this model, when generalized to include charged magnetic walls, explains the counterintuitive attraction observed between vortices and a Bloch wall of opposite polarity."

Deliveries recorded in the compulsory Medical Birth Registry of Norway 1999-2011 formed the study population. All 2,600 children exposed to antiepileptic drugs during pregnancy were compared to all 771,412 unexposed children born to women without epilepsy. Children of untreated mothers with epilepsy served as an internal control group. The main outcomes were small for gestational age birth weight and head circumference, and major congenital malformations. Children exposed to antiepileptic drugs had a moderate risk of growth restriction. Infants exposed to topiramate had a considerable risk of microcephaly (11.4 vs. 2.4 %; OR 4.8; CI 2.5-9.3) and small for gestational age birth weight (24.4 vs. 8.9 %; OR 3.1; 95 % CI 1.9-5.3). Carbamazepine, lamotrigine, levetiracetam, oxcarbazepine, gabapentin, and pregabalin had low malformation rates, whereas topiramate tended to have an elevated malformation rate. Valproate monotherapy was associated with a significant risk of birth defects (6.3 vs. 2.9 %; OR 2.5; CI 1.6-3.8), and specifically with septal heart defects and hypospadias. For mothers using valproate, the presence of major birth defect in one child was associated with a markedly increased risk for the siblings (42.9 vs. 6.7 %; OR 10.4; CI 2.3-46.7). Children of untreated mothers with epilepsy had malformation risk similar to the reference group. In conclusion, topiramate was associated with a substantial risk of fetal growth restriction, and possibly an increased malformation rate. Other newer-generation antiepileptic drugs had a low malformation rate. Valproate monotherapy had a significant malformation risk, especially in repeated pregnancies."

We found no significant differences between the two patient groups regarding tpl or PA activities of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBM) isolated during the postoperative phase. However, in the nonsteroid group there was a tendency for increased expression of procoagulant activity and decreased fibrinolytic activity on the 1st postoperative day, favoring the formation of fibrin in the monocyte microenvironment. Further, PBM isolated on the 1st and 2nd day after surgery were significantly less capable of generating tpl activity on endotoxin stimulation than cells isolated preoperatively. This was not the case in the steroid group. These patients had also a tendency for decreased fibrinolysis at the end of the 1st postoperative week, indicating increased imbalance towards a more thrombotic stage after surgery."

Volume: 101 Issue: 3A Feb 04 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18243861/,"Across the entire spectrum of ischemic heart disease, amino-terminal pro-B-type natriuretic peptides (NT-proBNP) are a strong and independent prognostic indicator, representing a particularly strong predictor of heart failure or death. This risk is independent of all other variables, including renal function or troponin, and is proportional to the magnitude of NT-proBNP release, with higher risk observed among those with a more marked elevation of the marker. Although prospective studies on the effect of NT-proBNP measurement in guiding therapy in ischemic heart disease are lacking, among patients presenting with acute coronary syndromes, it is recommended to measure NT-proBNP on (or near) the time of admission. An elevated initial NT-proBNP concentration should prompt consideration of an early invasive management approach. Consideration should be given to repeating the NT-proBNP measurement after 24-72 hours and again at 3-6 months because these follow-up measurements provide more long-term prognostic information than single measures at presentation. In acute ischemic heart disease, an NT-proBNP value >250 ng/L is associated with an adverse prognosis. In patients with stable coronary artery disease, measurement may be performed for prognostication purposes at 6- to 18-month intervals. In the case of clinical suspicion of disease progression, a new sample may be warranted."

Task performance provoked EMG activation at all recording sites and in both subject groups, and scores failed to distinguish between the groups. However, the quality of task performance was inferior in the fibromyalgia group. Responses to motivational state measures obtained from the experimental situation revealed no group differences. The fibromyalgia subjects reported relatively high exposure to stressors attributed to their own body (but not to work, family, and economy), and high efforts invested to cope with such stressors in everyday life. The results failed to support a role for high muscle tension and anxiety in fibromyalgia."

However, very little is known on how Meliponini, a taxon restricted to tropical and subtropical regions, respond to different store conditions. We studied the impact of honey removal on nectar foraging activity and recruitment behaviour in Melipona scutellaris and compared our results with studies of the honey bee Apis mellifera. As expected, foraging activity increased significantly during abundance of artificial nectar and when increasing its profitability. Foraging activity on colony level could thereby frequently increase by an order of magnitude. Intriguingly, however, poor honey store conditions did not induce increased nectar foraging or recruitment activity. We discuss possible reasons explaining why increasing recruitment and foraging activity are not used by meliponines to compensate for poor food conditions in the nest. Among these are meliponine specific adaptations to climatic and environmental conditions, as well as physiology and brood rearing, such as mass provisioning of the brood. "

Volume: 11 Issue: 6 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27248835/,"The eastern Atlantic and Mediterranean marine Cephalaspidea gastropod Haminoea orbignyana was collected from Lake Qarun (Fayoum, Egypt), a landlocked lake that has undergone a shift from freshwater to estuarine conditions in the past 100 years. Species identity was confirmed by both morphological (anatomical dissection and scanning electron microscopy) and molecular methods (COI gene phylogeny). Observations suggested a robust population of H. orbignyana in the lake with a density of ca. 64 individuals/m2 and ca. 105 egg masses/m2 during surveys conducted in the summer of 2013. The vast majority of snails and egg masses were found under rocks. Observations of egg masses in the lab showed a gradual change from whitish to yellow-green as the eggs matured and the release of veliger larvae alone after about a week. Although adult cephalaspideans readily consumed filamentous red and green algae, and cyanobacteria, laboratory trials showed that they consumed significantly more of the red alga Ceramium sp., than of the green alga Cladophora glomerata, with consumption of Oscillatoria margaritifera being similar to those on the two algae. When grown on these resources for 16 days, H. orbignyana maintained their mass on the rhodophyte and cyanobacterium, but not in starvation controls. No cephalaspideans grew over the course of this experiment. Lake Qarun has been periodically restocked with Mediterranean fishes and prawns since the 1920s to maintain local fisheries, which represents a possible route of colonization for H. orbignyana. Yet, based on literature records, it seems more likely that invasion of the lake by this gastropod species has occurred only within the last 20 years. As human activities redistribute species through direct and indirect means, the structure of the community of this inland lake has become unpredictable and the long-term effects of these recent introductions are unknown.

359,"Environmental, genomic and taxonomic perspectives on methanotrophic Verrucomicrobia.",23765882,Environmental microbiology reports. Volume: 1 Issue: 5 Oct 2009,2009,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23765882/,"Aerobic methanotrophic bacteria are capable of utilizing methane as their sole energy source. They are commonly found at the oxic/anoxic interfaces of environments such as wetlands, aquatic sediments, and landfills, where they feed on methane produced in anoxic zones of these environments. Until recently, all known species of aerobic methanotrophs belonged to the phylum Proteobacteria, in the classes Gammaproteobacteria and Alphaproteobacteria. However, in 2007-2008 three research groups independently described the isolation of thermoacidophilic methanotrophs that represented a distinct lineage within the bacterial phylum Verrucomicrobia. Isolates were obtained from geothermal areas in Italy, New Zealand and Russia. They are by far the most acidophilic methanotrophs known, with a lower growth limit below pH 1. Here we summarize the properties of these novel methanotrophic Verrucomicrobia, compare them with the proteobacterial methanotrophs, propose a unified taxonomic framework for them and speculate on their potential environmental significance. New genomic and physiological data are combined with existing information to allow detailed comparison of the three strains. We propose the new genus Methylacidiphilum to encompass all three newly discovered bacteria."

Volume: 10 Issue: 6 Nov 1987,1987,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2446275/,"The relationship between rate response and exercise tolerance was studied by measuring the symptom-limited maximum treadmill time (MTT)both during fixed rate VVI pacing and during VVI + activity mode pacing (RRP) in 15 patients (mean age, 73 years) who had received rate-responsive ventricular pacemakers. Their indications were atrioventricular block, sino-atrial block, and atrial fibrillation with slow ventricular response. Basic rate was programmed to 60 ppm in both pacing modes; rate response and activity threshold were programmed to 5 and medium, respectively. The order in which the two pacing modes were tested was randomly determined. The MTT was, on average, 29% longer in RRP than in VVI mode with a mean of 12 minutes in VVI and 14.8 minutes in RRP (p less than 0.001). For the subgroup of eight patients with paced-only rhythm the average increase in MTT was 38% with a mean of 9.5 minutes in VVI and 12.8 minutes in RRP (p less than 0.01). Seven patients who showed episodes of spontaneous rhythm, increased their average MTT by 17% (mean in VVI, 14.9 minutes; in RRP, 17.1 minutes; p less than 0.02). During RRP, a significant positive correlation existed between MTT and the increase in heart rate (N = 15; r = 0.83; p less than 0.001). In 12 patients with paced-only rhythm, the pacing rate remained at the programmed basic rate when the patients were lying, sitting, and standing and increased to 86 +/- 4 ppm during casual walking, and to 101 +/- 4 ppm during jumping up and down with the pacemaker programmed to the above-mentioned parameters. The maximum pacing rate during jumping corresponded with the maximum pacing rates measured from Holter recordings during normal daily activities."

Volume: 80 Issue: 2 Feb 2009,2009,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19151959/,"About 6% of patients with thyroid cancer present with life-threatening tumor invasion of the trachea and/or esophagus. The extent of resection depends on tumor diagnosis and stage (indication only in differentiated and perhaps medullary thyroid cancer without extrapulmonary metastases), extent of aerodigestive invasion, and general health state of the patient. After complete tumor resection, 5-year and 10-year survival rates of 40-75% can be achieved. Incomplete tumor resection however has a negative effect on prognosis. Tangential tumor resection (shaving) is indicated if no transmural invasion of trachea/esophagus has occurred. Tracheal resection can be subdivided into six standard procedures--types 1 and 2: laryngotracheal or tracheal window resection; types 3 and 4: circular resection with primary reconstruction infraglottic or tracheal; and types 5 and 6: laryngectomy and cervical evisceration."

368,"Circadian regulation gene polymorphisms are associated with sleep disruption and duration, and circadian phase and rhythm in adults with HIV.",26512752,Chronobiology international. Volume: 32 Issue: 9 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26512752/,"Genes involved in circadian regulation, such as circadian locomotor output cycles kaput [CLOCK], cryptochrome [CRY1] and period [PER], have been associated with sleep outcomes in prior animal and human research. However, it is unclear whether polymorphisms in these genes are associated with the sleep disturbances commonly experienced by adults living with human immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS). Thus, the purpose of this study was to describe polymorphisms in selected circadian genes that are associated with sleep duration or disruption as well as the sleep-wake rhythm strength and phase timing among adults living with HIV/AIDS. A convenience sample of 289 adults with HIV/AIDS was recruited from HIV clinics and community sites in the San Francisco Bay Area. A wrist actigraph was worn for 72 h on weekdays to estimate sleep duration or total sleep time (TST), sleep disruption or percentage of wake after sleep onset (WASO) and several circadian rhythm parameters: mesor, amplitude, the ratio of mesor to amplitude (circadian quotient), and 24-h autocorrelation. Circadian phase measures included clock time for peak activity (acrophase) from actigraphy movement data, and bed time and final wake time from actigraphy and self-report. Genotyping was conducted for polymorphisms in five candidate genes involved in circadian regulation: CLOCK, CRY1, PER1, PER2 and PER3. Demographic and clinical variables were evaluated as potential covariates. Interactions between genotype and HIV variables (i.e. viral load, years since HIV diagnosis) were also evaluated. Controlling for potentially confounding variables (e.g. race, gender, CD4+ T-cell count, waist circumference, medication use, smoking and depressive symptoms), CLOCK was associated with WASO, 24-h autocorrelation and objectively-measured bed time; CRY1 was associated with circadian quotient; PER1 was associated with mesor and self-reported habitual wake time; PER2 was associated with TST, mesor, circadian quotient, 24-h autocorrelation and bed and wake times; PER3 was associated with amplitude, 24-h autocorrelation, acrophase and bed and wake times. Most of the observed associations involved a significant interaction between genotype and HIV. In this chronic illness population, polymorphisms in several circadian genes were associated with measures of sleep disruption and timing. These findings extend the evidence for an association between genetic variability in circadian regulation and sleep outcomes to include the sleep-wake patterns experienced by adults living with HIV/AIDS. These results provide direction for future intervention research related to circadian sleep-wake behavior patterns. "
369,Birth weight as a predictor of breast cancer: a case-control study in Norway.,11857017,British journal of cancer. Volume: 86 Issue: 1 Jan 07 2002,2002,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11857017/,"The hypothesis that birth weight is positively associated with adult risk of breast cancer implies that factors related to intrauterine growth may be important for the development of this malignancy. Using stored birth records from the two main hospitals in Trondheim and Bergen, Norway, we collected information on birth weight, birth length and placenta weight among 373 women who developed breast cancer. From the same archives, we selected as controls 1150 women of identical age as the cases without a history of breast cancer. Information on age at first birth and parity were collected from the Central Person Registry in Norway. Based on conditional logistic regression analysis, breast cancer risk was positively associated with birth weight and with birth length (P for trend=0.02). Birth weights in the highest quartile (3730 g or more) were associated with 40% higher risk (odds ratio, 1.4, 95% confidence interval, 1.1-1.9) of breast cancer compared to birth weights in the lowest quartile (less than 3090 g). For birth length, the odds ratio for women who were 51.5 cm or more (highest quartile) was 1.3 (95% confidence interval, 1.0-1.8) compared to being less than 50 cm (lowest quartile) at birth. Adjustment for age at first birth and parity did not change these estimates. Placenta weight was not associated with breast cancer risk. This study provides strong evidence that intrauterine factors may influence future risk of breast cancer. A common feature of such factors would be their ability to stimulate foetal growth and, simultaneously, to influence intrauterine development of the mammary gland."

Twenty-two well-trained cross-country skiers (31 ± 4 years, 77 ± 9 kg, 181 ± 8 cm, VO2max running: 64 ± 5 mL·kg-1·min-1) were counter-balanced to either a combined muscular endurance and running interval training group [MET; n = 11 (♂ = 9, ♀ = 2)], or an endurance running interval training group [ET; n = 11 (♂ = 9, ♀ = 2)]. Both groups continued their normal low-and moderate intensity training, but replaced 2 weekly high intensity-training sessions with two project-specific sessions for 6 weeks. In these sessions, MET combined upper-body muscular endurance training (4 × 30 repetitions, 90 s rest between sets) and running intervals (3 × 4 or 2 × 6 min, 3 min rest), while ET performed running intervals only (6 × 4 or 4 × 6 min, 3 min rest). The DP test-protocol consisted of 50 min submaximal poling for O2-cost measurement, followed by a self-paced 1,000-m performance test. In addition, subjects performed a VO2max test in running. MET increased muscular endurance (P < 0.05) and 1RM in simulated DP (P < 0.01) more than ET. Further, MET reduced the 1,000-m time and O2-cost compared to baseline values (P < 0.05), and tended to improve the 1,000-m time more than ET (P = 0.06). There were no changes in VO2max running or VO2peak DP in either MET or ET. In conclusion, 6 weeks of muscular endurance training increased both muscular endurance and 1RM in simulated DP. Further, specific upper-body muscular endurance training improved DP performance and thus, seems as a promising training model to optimize performance in well-trained cross-country skiers."

Volume: 63 Issue: 1 Jan 01 1989,1989,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2910415/,"In 13 patients who had been thyroidectomized for medullary carcinoma (MCT), basal and pentagastrin-stimulated immunoreactive calcitonin (iCT) concentrations were measured in a peripheral vein and concomitantly in hepatic veins as well as in the superior and inferior caval veins. The basal concentrations of iCT in serum from the antecubital vein ranged from normal values (less than 0.50 micrograms/1) to grossly elevated (greater than 100 micrograms/1). Intravenous pentagastrin injections (0.5 micrograms/kg) stimulated transiently calcitonin secretion in all patients and peak concentrations occurred in peripheral venous blood and in the inferior caval vein after 3 to 5 minutes. In all patients peak iCT values in the hepatic vein occurred at 1 to 2 minutes and were much higher than in samples taken from other veins. Only three patients showed metastases to liver as judged by conventional clinical and laboratory examinations. Two patients with nonthyroid, malignant disease did not show an increase in serum iCT concentration of hepatic veins. The authors conclude that MCT may spread early to the liver. The presence of liver metastases is an important prognostic factor in patient evaluation and can be demonstrated by measuring iCT in hepatic veins before and during pentagastrin stimulation."

Volume: 4 Issue: 4 Dec 15 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15198558/,"The purpose of this research was to adapt a colorimetric, phospholipase D-based serum-phospholipid assay for the quantification of phosphatidylcholine (PC) in liposomes using a microtitre plate reader. PC from natural egg PC liposomes was quantified reliably. In contrast, poor sensitivity was found for liposomes composed of saturated PCs (di-palmitoyl-phosphatidylcholine [DPPC], hydrogenated egg PC). Triton X-100 was then added to the liposomes followed by heating above the phase transition temperature. This modified sample preparation resulted in recoveries of 102.6% +/- 1.0%, 104.4% +/- 7.6%, and 109.4% +/- 3.2% for E80, E80-3/cholesterol, and DPPC liposomes, respectively. Absolute quantification of unknown PCs against a choline chloride standard is feasible, but relative measurements against the very same PC are recommended whenever possible. Validation experiments revealed an absolute quantification limit of 1.25 microg per assay, a good linearity in the range of 25 to 1000 microg/mL PC (r2> or = 0.9990) and a quite high accuracy (99.8%-101.4% of theory) and precision (relative standard deviation < or = 3.2%) for all 3 PCs studied. The method is thus regarded as suitable for sensitive, rapid, and reliable routine quantification of PCs in liposomes."
374,The Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire in Norway.,23480438,Scandinavian journal of psychology. Volume: 54 Issue: 3 Jun 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23480438/,"The aim of this study was to adapt the Five Factor Mindfulness Questionnaire (FFMQ) for use in Norway. Three studies involving three different samples of university students (mean age 22 years, total N = 792) were conducted. Confirmatory factor analyses showed that a five factor structure provided an acceptable fit to the data. All five factors loaded significantly on the overall mindfulness factor. As expected, correlations between the FFMQ total scores and subscales were positive and significant, ranging from 0.45 to 0.65. Correlations between FFMQ total/subscales and Mindful Attention Awareness Scale (MAAS) were significant and negative (since low scores on the MAAS indicate high mindfulness), ranging from r = -0.17 to -0.69. The Norwegian FFMQ total score was inversely correlated with all indicators of psychological health: neuroticism (r = -0.61), ruminative tendencies (r = -0.41), self-related negative thinking (r = -0.40), emotion regulation difficulties (r = -0.66) and depression (r = -0.46 to r = -0.65). In contrast to the other FFMQ subscales, the FFMQ Observe subscale did not have a positive relation to psychological health in our mostly non-meditating sample. However, being able to non-judgmentally observe one's inner life and environment is a part of the mindfulness construct that might emerge more clearly with more mindfulness training. We conclude that the Norwegian FFMQ has acceptable psychometric properties and can be recommended for use in Norway, especially in studies seeking to differentiate between different aspects of mindfulness and how these may change over time."

Volume: 88 Issue: 2 Jun 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21295920/,"In Norway, most lambs are slaughtered at the end of the grazing season in September. An increased demand for fresh meat during the off-season may change this pattern. Castration of male lambs is not permitted, and off-season slaughtering may affect the acceptability of the meat. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of gender and the interaction between gender and diet on meat quality from Norwegian White Sheep lambs slaughtered in September. In two different experiments, 22 and 29 males compared with 22 and 46 female lambs, respectively, were used. Loin samples of M. Longissimus dorsi were analysed for sensory profile and fatty acid composition. Meat from male lambs in Experiment 2 had higher scores for cloying and rancid flavour, and lower scores for sour and sweet taste compared to meat from female lambs. It is concluded that even at the normal slaughtering time in September, significant differences between genders may occur."

Volume: 121 Issue: 6 Dec 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/14675171/,"The basal cells in epithelium of the erythematous form of oral lichen display hyperproliferation compared with normal oral mucosa. In this study we examined whether this is associated with disrupted production, activation, or signal transduction of the epithelial growth inhibitor transforming growth factor (TGF) beta1. In situ immunostaining showed that most epithelial cells in normal oral mucosa had nuclear and cytoplasmic Smad4 and phosphorylated Smad2/3, but expressed little or no Smad7. Expression of latency-associated peptide TGF-beta1, latent TGF-beta binding protein 1, TGF-beta type I receptor, and TGF-beta type II receptor was readily seen, but only very little TGF-beta1 was activated. In erythematous oral lichen, basal and lower spinous epithelial layers showed staining for latency-associated peptide TGF-beta1, TGF-beta type I receptor, and TGF-beta type II receptor. A band with scanty staining for these molecules, but with marked staining for active TGF-beta1, was seen in the upper spinous and granular layers. Numbers of epithelial cell nuclei with Smad4 and phosphorylated Smad2/3 staining were significantly reduced in erythematous oral lichen compared with normal oral mucosa. Basal and suprabasal cell layers in erythematous oral lichen showed strong cytoplasmic Smad7 protein staining, but in spinous and granular layers Smad7 was localized to the cell membrane. In situ hybridization showed strong Smad7 mRNA expression in almost all basal keratinocytes in erythematous oral lichen; by contrast, no or occasionally very weak Smad7 mRNA expression was seen in these cells in normal oral mucosa. The observations indicate that inhibition of the TGF-beta/Smad pathway may account for the hyperproliferation of keratinocytes in erythematous oral lichen."

The sample was prepared by a protein precipitation with ice-cold methanol/acetonitrile mixture (85:15, v/v). The organic phase was evaporated to dryness and the residue was dissolved in the mobile phase. Separation, with gradient elution and an acidic mobile phase, was achieved on an Acquity UPLC® HSS T3 column. The compounds were quantified using a multiple reaction-monitoring mode. Two transitions were monitored for each compound and one for the deuterated internal standards. The mass spectrometric detection in the positive ion mode was performed for all the compounds except salicylic acid which was detected in the negative ionization mode. The limits of quantification were as follows: acetaminophen 0.30 mg/L, dexchlorpheniramine 0.0050 mg/L, caffeine 0.099 mg/L, cotinine 0.00035 mg/L and salicylic acid 1.3 mg/L. Between-assay and within-assay precisions were ≤15% (biases: -10% to 26%) and ≤10%, respectively. Extraction recoveries varied from 93% to 137%. The matrix effects in blood, corrected with deuterated internal standards, were 100% ± 10% for all compounds except dexchlorpheniramine (111%) and caffeine (138%)."

Inconsistencies were few when the subjects selected statements about symptoms. Cough score discriminated between groups of healthy persons with various smoking habits. Wheezing score distinguished healthy persons from patients with obstructive lung disease more accurately than cough, attacks of breathlessness and dyspnoea score. Regression analyses showed that per score point of dyspnoea and cough the peak expiratory flow rate decreased by almost 12 and 7% of predicted, respectively."

Volume: 119 Issue: 4 Aug 15 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16557573/,"It is controversial whether women have a higher lung cancer susceptibility compared to men. We previously reported higher levels of smoking-related bulky DNA adducts in female lungs. In a pilot study (27 cases), we also found a higher level of female lung cytochrome P4501A1 (CYP1A1) gene expression. In the present extended study we report on the pulmonary expression of several genes involved in polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon bioactivation in relation to sex, smoking and DNA adducts. CYP1A1, CYP1B1, aryl hydrocarbon receptor and microsomal epoxide hydrolase gene expression was measured by quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase-PCR in 121 normal lung tissue samples. The expression of CYP1A1 and CYP1B1 was significantly higher among current smokers compared to ex-smokers and never-smokers. Among current smokers, females had a 3.9-fold higher median level of CYP1A1 compared to males (p = 0.011). CYP1B1 expression was not related to sex. Lung DNA adducts (measured by 32P-postlabeling) were highly significantly related to CYP1A1 (p < 0.0001) irrespective of smoking-status. Our results are consistent with the hypothesis that CYP1A1 plays a significant role in lung DNA adduct formation and support a higher susceptibility to lung cancer among females."

Volume: 80 Issue: 5 Nov 1998,1998,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9843183/,"Since the role of leukocytes found present in thrombi and haemostatic plugs is not clearly understood. we have investigated the interaction between leukocytes and growing thrombi in a human ex vivo model of arterial thrombogenesis. At a wall shear rate characteristic of moderately stenosed arteries (2600 s(-1)), granulocytes selectively accumulated at the luminal surface of platelet thrombi. The leukocyte adhesion seemed independent of fibrin formation and was clearly correlated to thrombus growth and platelet activation. In contrast, flow cytometry revealed that the expression of adhesion molecules (CD11a, CD11b, CD11, CD3, CD14, CD62L, HLA-DR and binding of fibrinogen) on the surface of circulating leukocytes passing the thrombi was, on short term conditions (15 min), independent of thrombus growth. The adhered granulocytes probably play a pivotal role in limiting the size of the evolving thrombi, as suggested by our electron micrographs of the arterial thrombi showing lysed and phagocytosed platelets. Thus, granulocytes might play an active role in the acute/semiacute phase of local thromboregulation."
386,Health-related quality of life and pain beliefs among people suffering from chronic pain.,15297953,Pain management nursing : official journal of the American Society of Pain Management Nurses. Volume: 5 Issue: 2 Jun 2004,2004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15297953/,"Chronic pain, when not effectively treated and relieved, may have a harmful effect on all aspects of health-related quality of life (HRQL). Furthermore, pain beliefs are considered an important mediating psychological factor in chronic pain. The present study focused on HRQL as measured by the Medical Outcomes Survey-Short Form (SF-36) and addressed possible relationships between pain beliefs as measured by the Pain Beliefs and Perceptions Inventory (PBAPI). The possible impact of background variables such as age, gender, social support, pain intensity, pain duration, and analgesics on HRQL were controlled for in the analyses. The study sample consisted of 81 people who were recruited from a multidisciplinary pain management program. Data were collected as the first part of a routine pretreatment evaluation. The chronic-pain patients reported lower scores on all dimensions of HRQL compared to normal controls and other patient groups. No significant association was found between pain beliefs and the physical health dimension of HRQL whereas gender, pain duration, and pain intensity were significant predictors of that dimension. In addition, one of the dimensions of pain beliefs (i.e., mystery) was found to be predictive of the mental health dimension of HRQL. Social support made an additional contribution to the explained variance in mental health. The implications of these results for assessing HRQL and pain beliefs in chronic pain are discussed."
387,Mixture design and multivariate analysis in mixture research.,9860895,Environmental health perspectives. Volume: 106 Suppl 6 Dec 1998,1998,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9860895/,"Mixture design has been used to identify possible interactions between mutagens in a mixture. In this paper the use of mixture design in multidimensional isobolographic studies is introduced. Mutagenicity of individual nitro-polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAH) was evaluated is an organic extract of diesel exhaust particles (DEPs). The particles were extracted with dichloromethane (DCM). After replacing DCM with dimethyl sulfoxide, the extract was spiked with three individual nitro-PAH: 1-nitropyrene, 2-nitrofluorene, and 1,8-dinitropyrene. The nitro-PAH were added separately and in various combinations to the extract to determine the effects of each variable and to identify possible interactions between the individual nitro-PAH and between the nitro-PAH and the extract. The composition of the mixtures was determined by mixture design (linear axial normal) with four variables (the DEP extract and the three nitro-PAH, giving 8 different mixtures plus a triplicate centerpoint, i.e., a total of 11. The design supports a model with linear and interaction (product) terms. Two different approaches were used: traditional mixture design within a well-defined range on the linear part of the dose-response curves and an isobolographic mixture design with equipotent doses of each variable. The mixtures were tested for mutagenicity in the Ames assay using the TA98 strain of Salmonella typhimurium. The data were analyzed with projections to latent structures (PLS). The three individual nitro-PAH and the DEP extract acted additively in the Ames test. The use of mixture design either within a well-defined range of the linear part on the dose-response curve or with equipotent doses saves experiments and reduces the possibility of false interaction terms in situations with dose additivity or response additivity."
388,Combined Env- and Gag-specific T cell responses in relation to programmed death-1 receptor and CD4 T cell loss rates in human immunodeficiency virus-1 infection.,20491784,Clinical and experimental immunology. Volume: 161 Issue: 2 Aug 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20491784/,"Additional progression markers for human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection are warranted. In this study we related antigen-specific responses in CD4(+) and CD8(+) T cells to CD38, reflecting chronic immune activation, and to CD4(+) T cell loss rates. Clones transiently expressing CD107a (CD8(+)) or CD154 (CD4(+)) in response to Gag, Env and Nef overlapping peptide pools were identified, along with their expression of the inhibitory programmed death-1 receptor (PD-1) in fresh peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) from 31 patients off antiretroviral treatment (ART). HIV-specific CD8(+) T cell responses dominated over CD4(+) T cell responses, and among CD8(+) responses, Gag and Nef responses were higher than Env-responses (P < 0.01). PD-1 on CD8(+) HIV-specific subsets was higher than CMV-specific CD8(+) cells (P < 0.01), whereas PD-1 on HIV-specific CD4(+) cells was similar to PD-1 on CMV-specific CD4(+) cells. Gag and Env CD8(+) responses correlated oppositely to the CD4 loss rate. Env/Gag CD8(+) response ratios, independently of PD-1 levels, correlated more strongly to CD4 change rates (r = -0.50 to -0.77, P < 0.01) than the total number of Gag-specific CD8(+) cells (r = 0.44-0.85, P < or = 0.02). The Env/Gag ratio performed better than CD38 and HIV-RNA in logistic regression analysis predicting CD4 change rate as a measure of progression. In conclusion, HIV-specific CD8(+)CD107a(+) Env/Gag response ratio was a stronger predictor for progression than CD38 and HIV-RNA. The Env/Gag ratio may reflect the balance between possibly beneficial (Gag) and detrimental (Env) CD8(+) T cell responses and should be explored further as a progression marker."
389,Glucocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid effects in rat Sertoli cells.,2909375,Endocrinology. Volume: 124 Issue: 1 Jan 1989,1989,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2909375/,"In this report we demonstrate glucocorticoid receptors in seminiferous tubules of the rat testis, and that these receptors are localized in Sertoli cells and peritubular cells. The receptors had high affinity for [3H]dexamethasone (Kd = 0.5 - 1 x 10(-9) M), and similar Kd values were calculated from equilibrium analysis and from rate studies (k1 = 1.5 x 10(6) M-1 min-1 and k-1 = 1.4 x 10(-3) min-1, O C). Binding specificity was typical for glucocorticoid receptors (affinity: dexamethasone greater than corticosterone greater than cortisol approximately R5020 approximately progesterone greater than aldosterone = R1881 greater than 17 beta-estradiol approximately cortisone approximately testosterone greater than 5 alpha-dihydrotestosterone). The concentration of glucocorticoid receptors in rat seminiferous tubules revealed an age-dependent decrease, coinciding with the increase in the number of germ cells. Glucocorticoid receptor levels were higher in Sertoli cells from immature rats than in cells from adult rats. Cultured peritubular cells from immature rats contained levels of glucocorticoid receptors similar to cultured Sertoli cells from rats of the same age. With a nick-translated human glucocorticoid receptor complementary DNA probe, a messenger RNA (mRNA) species of approximately 7 kilobase was clearly detected in both Sertoli cells and peritubular cells. In peritubular cells, a smaller mRNA species (5 kilobase) was also clearly detectable. In mRNA from whole testis tissue, a similar developmental pattern as for dexamethasone binding was found. Dexamethasone caused a concentration-dependent stimulation of mRNA levels for androgen binding protein and for the cAMP-dependent protein kinase regulatory subunit type II beta in cultured immature rat Sertoli cells. On the other hand, mRNA levels for glucocorticoid receptor decreased, whereas mRNA levels for beta-actin remained constant. This report documents for the first time the presence of glucocorticoid receptors and glucocorticoid effects in rat Sertoli cells, and is also the first demonstration of glucocorticoid receptors in peritubular cells of the rat testis."

391,Exosome-derived miRNAs and ovarian carcinoma progression.,24925027,Carcinogenesis. Volume: 35 Issue: 9 Sep 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24925027/,"The objective of this study was to analyze the expression, biological role and clinical relevance of exosomal microRNAs (miRNAs) from ovarian carcinoma (OC) effusion supernatants. Exosomal miRNA expression profiling was performed using miRNA Taqman arrays. Selected miRNAs were validated using quantitative PCR in 86 OC effusion supernatants. The role of exosomal miRNA in this cancer was further studied using in vitro and in vivo models. miRNA profiling identified 99 miRNAs with high expression levels in exosomes from OC effusion supernatants. Quantitative PCR validation of 11 miRNAs showed significant associations with effusion site (peritoneum versus pleura) and International Federation of Gynecology and Obstetrics stage. In univariate survival analysis, high levels of miRNAs 21, 23b and 29a were associated with poor progression-free survival (P = 0.01, P = 0.015 and P = 0.009, respectively), whereas high expression of miRNA 21 correlated with poor overall survival (P = 0.017). The latter association was retained in Cox multivariate analysis (P = 0.001). Exposure of LP9 mesothelial cells and ES2 OC cells to OC effusion-derived exosomes inhibited tumor spheroid expansion and reduced mesothelial clearance area. Treatment of severe combined immunodeficiency mice with exosomes from OC effusions prior to injection of tumor cells was associated with larger tumor load, more infiltrative tumors and shorter survival. Patient-derived OC effusion exosomes contain multiple miRNAs, of which some may have clinical relevance. In experimental models, OC exosomes affect both tumor cells and cells in the tumor microenvironment and induce more aggressive disease. Collectively, these data demonstrate the central role of miRNAs and their content in the biology of this cancer. "

However, all-gas-phase deposition techniques are currently not available for such MOFs. We here report on thin-film deposition of the thermally and chemically stable UiO-66 in an all-gas-phase process by the aid of atomic layer deposition (ALD). Sequential reactions of ZrCl4 and 1,4-benzenedicarboxylic acid produce amorphous organic-inorganic hybrid films that are subsequently crystallized to the UiO-66 structure by treatment in acetic acid vapour. We also introduce a new approach to control the stoichiometry between metal clusters and organic linkers by modulation of the ALD growth with additional acetic acid pulses. An all-gas-phase synthesis technique for UiO-66 could enable implementations in microelectronics that are not compatible with solvothermal synthesis. Since this technique is ALD-based, it could also give enhanced thickness control and the possibility to coat irregular substrates with high aspect ratios."

The checklist provided different functionality for the different users, ranging from a memory/attention support to a standardized form of communication on safety matters. However, the rigidity afforded by the electronic implementation, showed some serious drawbacks over the prior, simpler, paper-based versions."

Volume: 127 Issue: 12 Dec 15 2010,2010,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21351257/,"The human protein N(α)-terminal acetyltransferase A complex (hNatA), composed of the catalytic hNaa10p (hArd1) and auxiliary hNaa15p (hNat1/NATH/Tubedown) subunits, was reported to be important for cell survival and growth of various types of cancer. However, little is known about the mechanisms mediating growth inhibition and apoptosis following loss of hNatA function. Here, we have screened 11 different thyroid cell lines for hNAA10 RNAi phenotypes and observed mostly growth inhibition, which was independent of TP53 functional status and developed by several different mechanisms involving (i) downregulation of cyclin D1, (ii) increase in p27/Kip1 and (iii) inactivation of Rb/E2F pathway. hNatA depletion in aggressive thyroid cancer cell lines (8305C, CAL-62 and FTC-133) with mutated TP53 increased sensitivity to drug-induced cytotoxicity, but in a cell type specific manner: 8305C (TRAIL), CAL-62 (daunorubicin) and FTC-133 (troglitazone). Cells harboring wild-type TP53 were also prone to apoptosis via the p53 pathway after hNatA downregulation. Importantly, in hNatA-depleted cells DNA-damage signaling was activated in the absence of exogenous DNA damage independent on TP53 status. Our findings indicate that several mechanisms of growth inhibition and apoptosis may be induced by hNatA knockdown and that hNatA knockdown could be exploited for use in combinatorial chemotherapy."

Volume: 163 Issue: 2 Feb 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25499021/,"Regular bathing in the Blue Lagoon in Iceland has beneficial effects on psoriasis. Cyanobacterium aponinum is a dominating member of the Blue Lagoon's microbial ecosystem. The aim of the study was to determine whether exopolysaccharides (EPSs) secreted by C. aponinum (EPS-Ca) had immunomodulatory effects in vitro. Human monocyte-derived dendritic cells (DCs) were matured in the absence or presence of EPS-Ca and the effects were determined by measuring the secretion of cytokines by ELISA and the expression of surface molecules by flow cytometry. DCs matured with EPS-Ca at 100 μg/ml secreted higher levels of IL-10 than untreated DCs. Subsequently, DCs matured in the presence or absence of EPS-Ca were co-cultured with allogeneic CD4(+) T cells and their effects on T cell activation analysed by measuring expression of intracellular and surface molecules and cytokine secretion. Supernatant from allogeneic T cells co-cultured with EPS-Ca-exposed DCs had raised levels of IL-10 compared with control. A reduced frequency of IL-17(+)RORγt(+) T cells was observed when co-cultured with EPS-Ca-exposed DCs and a tendency towards increased frequency of FoxP3(+)IL-10(+) T cells, resulting in a lower IL-17(+)RORγt(+)/FoxP3(+)IL-10(+) ratio. The study shows that EPSs secreted by C. aponinum stimulate DCs to produce vast amounts of the immunosuppressive cytokine IL-10. These DCs induce differentiation of allogeneic CD4(+) T cells with an increased Treg but decreased Th17 phenotype. These data suggest that EPSs from C. aponinum may play a role in the beneficial clinical effect on psoriasis following bathing in the Blue Lagoon."

We have studied the involvement of monocytes (MOs) in the immune response to OK-432 by examining MCP-1, MIP-1α and MIP-1β secretion, in vitro. OK-432-induced IL-6/TNF-α secretion has previously been shown to depend on mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) ERK1/2 and p38, and we therefore investigated the role of these MAPKs in OK-432-induced chemokine secretion. Here we demonstrate that pharmacological MEK1/2 kinase inhibition generally impaired chemokine secretion from MOs, whereas p38 MAPK inhibition in particular reduced MIP-1α production. Furthermore, simultaneous inhibition of MEK1/2 and Syk kinase was seen to have an additive impact on reduced MCP-1, MIP-1α and MIP-1β secretion. Based on single cell flow cytometry analyses, OK-432, lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) were seen to induce p38 MAPK and NF-κB phosphorylation in MOs with different time kinetics. LTA and LPS have been shown to induce ERK1/2 phosphorylation, whereas the levels of phosphorylated ERK1/2 remained constant following OK-432 treatment at the time points tested. Toll-like receptors (TLRs) recognize pathogen-associated molecular patterns, and we demonstrate increased TLR2 cell surface levels on the MO population, most profoundly following stimulation with LTA and OK-432. Together these results indicate that modulation of MEK1/2 and p38 MAPK signalling could affect the response to OK-432 treatment, having the potential to improve its therapeutic potential within cancer and lymphangioma treatment."

Volume: 8 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28769873/,"Heart failure with preserved ejection fraction (HFpEF) is a major unmet medical need that is characterized by the presence of multiple cardiovascular and non-cardiovascular comorbidities. Foremost among these comorbidities are obesity and diabetes, which are not only risk factors for the development of HFpEF, but worsen symptoms and outcome. Coronary microvascular inflammation with endothelial dysfunction is a common denominator among HFpEF, obesity, and diabetes that likely explains at least in part the etiology of HFpEF and its synergistic relationship with obesity and diabetes. Thus, pharmacological strategies to supplement nitric oxide and subsequent cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP)-protein kinase G (PKG) signaling may have therapeutic promise. Other potential approaches include exercise and lifestyle modifications, as well as targeting endothelial cell mineralocorticoid receptors, non-coding RNAs, sodium glucose transporter 2 inhibitors, and enhancers of natriuretic peptide protective NO-independent cGMP-initiated and alternative signaling, such as LCZ696 and phosphodiesterase-9 inhibitors. Additionally, understanding the role of adipokines in HFpEF may lead to new treatments. Identifying novel drug targets based on the shared underlying microvascular disease process may improve the quality of life and lifespan of those afflicted with both HFpEF and obesity or diabetes, or even prevent its occurrence."

Volume: 81 Issue: 4 1992,1992,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1485790/,"Thirty-one femoral shaft fractures in patients over 60 years of age were treated with the Grosse-Kempf slotted, locked intramedullary nail and followed for a median of 24 months. The patients tolerated the operation reasonably well and the mortality was not higher than the mortality connected with femoral neck fractures. Three reoperations were performed due to intra- and postoperative complications. The main reason for the less satisfactory result was shortening > 2 cm after unstable dynamical locking. This occurred in 8 of 15 dynamically nailed fractures with locking screw(s) in one end of the nail only. A 9 cm shortening among these was the reason for one of the two poor results in the series. The other poor result was a malalignment of the distal fragment in a statically locked fracture. We conclude that locked intramedullary nailing is a good way to treat femoral shaft fractures in the elderly, the high subtrochanteric, midshaft and infraisthmic fractures."

Volume: 179 Issue: 2 Oct 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26065402/,"Seedling recruitment is a critical life history stage for trees, and successful recruitment is tightly linked to both abiotic factors and biotic interactions. In order to better understand how tree species' distributions may change in response to anticipated climate change, more knowledge of the effects of complex climate and biotic interactions is needed. We conducted a seed-sowing experiment to investigate how temperature, precipitation and biotic interactions impact recruitment of Scots pine (Pinus sylvestris) and Norway spruce (Picea abies) seedlings in southern Norway. Seeds were sown into intact vegetation and experimentally created gaps. To study the combined effects of temperature and precipitation, the experiment was replicated across 12 sites, spanning a natural climate gradient from boreal to alpine and from sub-continental to oceanic. Seedling emergence and survival were assessed 12 and 16 months after sowing, respectively, and above-ground biomass and height were determined at the end of the experiment. Interestingly, very few seedlings were detected in the boreal sites, and the highest number of seedlings emerged and established in the alpine sites, indicating that low temperature did not limit seedling recruitment. Site precipitation had an overall positive effect on seedling recruitment, especially at intermediate precipitation levels. Seedling emergence, establishment and biomass were higher in gap plots compared to intact vegetation at all temperature levels. These results suggest that biotic interactions in the form of competition may be more important than temperature as a limiting factor for tree seedling recruitment in the sub- and low-alpine zone of southern Norway."

The objective of this work was to apply a suspect screening methodology to detect chemotherapy and radiotherapy drugs and their related compounds such metabolites and/or biomarkers in wastewater. The use of logical pre-determined criteria to refine the suspect list down to a relatively small number of relevant compounds greatly improved the efficiency of the analysis. Mass accuracy, isotopic patterns and predicted retention time were used to tentatively identify the suspects. Successful identification of cancer-related suspects included two antineoplastic hormones, two X-ray contrast agents and a pyrrolizidine alkaloid related to an herbal medicine. This is the first time that a suspect screening paradigm has been successfully applied to the identification of pharmaceuticals and biomarkers related to chemotherapy in wastewater. "

For this purpose, 42 male athletes were recruited from one of the largest BJJ academies in central Norway. The subjects were 32 ± 6 (SD) years old, 181.9 ± 7.2 cm tall, had a body mass (mb) of 85.7 ± 10.6 kg, and 5.5 ± 3.7 years of BJJ training experience. The subjects underwent segmental multifrequency bioelectrical impedance analysis of body composition (BIA), direct measurements of pulmonary function and maximal oxygen uptake (V[Combining Dot Above]O2max), assessments of 1-repetition maximum (1RM) in the parallel squat and paused bench press, and one set of pronated-grip pull-ups to muscular failure. The average body fat percentage (BF) was 12.9 ± 5.3%. The subjects achieved a V[Combining Dot Above]O2max of 50.6 ± 4.6 mL·kg·min. Absolute squat 1RM (113.2 ± 20.4 kg) was significantly higher than bench press 1RM (87.6 ± 16.5 kg) (p < 0.001). The mean number of pull-ups achieved was 9 ± 4. These characteristics were generally independent of rank, training experience, weekly training volume, competition volume, and style preference. Additional strength training was associated with improved bench press performance (p < 0.05). Beyond that, additional strength and/or conditioning training had no apparent relationship with any variable (p > 0.05). This study provides novel insight into the fitness levels of BJJ athletes. These findings indicate the degree of exercise response to BJJ training and are applicable in athlete assessment and exercise prescription in this population."

All antibodies reacted with a range of different xanthans. Competition studies using variants of the exopopolysaccharide as competitors suggested that specificity was mainly against the side-chain. One of the antibodies (B3) appeared to require the fully acylated side-chain with the pyruvylated terminal mannose as the immunodominant part. The three others were assumed to be directed against the nonsubstituted trisaccharide with the inner mannose-glucuronic acid being immunodominant. None of the antibodies reacted with cellulose (the xanthan backbone). Using immunoblotting techniques on nitrocellulose paper both a mixture of monoclonal antibodies, and also polyclonal ascitic fluid, could detect xanthan quantities of approximately 0.1 microgram."

The questionnaire consisted of items covering various aspects considered important for patients who regularly use inhalation devices. The questions were designed to be of a general character so any inhalation device could be evaluated. We evaluated the questionnaire in a multicenter, open crossover study comparing patients' opinions of MDI with and without spacer and of a dry powder inhaler, Turbuhaler. One hundred twenty-three patients with stable asthma confirmed by daily peak expiratory flow rate (PEF) measurements used for 2 weeks MDI only and MDI with spacer and for 2 weeks Turbuhaler. The order was randomized. The drugs were terbutaline inhaled via MDI and Turbuhaler and budesonide inhaled via MDI with spacer and turbuhaler. At the end of each evaluation period the patients answered a number of questions about their opinion by marking on a visual analogue scale. A factor analysis revealed that the different questions represent a few common factors important for evaluating opinion about inhalation devices. These factors are handling of the device, use, time to learn how to use the device properly, how confident the patients feel about the use of it, and taste/irritation. A standardized questionnaire of reduced size seems to be a suitable method for evaluating patient preference for different inhalation devices."

Volume: 140 Issue: 1 07 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27475190/,"Relationships between noise exposure and transportation noise induced annoyance have been studied extensively for several decades. The annoyance due to aircraft noise exposure is in the present paper assumed to be influenced by the day-night yearly average sound level (DNL). It has long been recognized that the annoyance also depends on non-DNL factors, but this is complicated-resulting in a variety of different modeling strategies. Motivated by this, the community tolerance level (CTL) was introduced in 2011 for a loudness-based psychometric function. It is a single parameter that accounts for the aggregate influence of other factors. This paper suggests and investigates different methods for the measurement of the CTL. The methods are illustrated on data found in the literature, on recent surveys around two Norwegian airports, and on simulated data. The results from the presented methods differ significantly. An elementary method is shown to give a measurement of the CTL with smaller uncertainty, and is recommended as a replacement for the originally suggested least-squares method. Methods for evaluating the measurement uncertainty are also presented."

Volume: 10 Issue: 2",,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10686449/,"Lipoprotein and hemostatic profiles including coagulation inhibitors were determined in 136 patients with acute ischemic stroke. Based on clinical examination, cerebral computed tomography, Doppler ultrasonography of precerebral arteries and transthoracic echocardiography, the strokes were classified as cardioembolic (n = 38), non-cardioembolic (n = 92), and mixed cardioembolic/hypertensive (n = 6). Patients with cardioembolic stroke were older than patients with non-cardioembolic stroke. Lipoprotein(a) was higher in the cardioembolic than in the non-cardioembolic group. Lipoprotein(a) was not significantly correlated to the other lipid levels and may represent an independent lipid risk factor. The non-cardioembolic group had higher levels of total cholesterol, triglycerides, total cholesterol/high-density lipoprotein cholesterol ratio, low-density lipoprotein cholesterol, apolipoprotein A1, and apolipoprotein B. The cardioembolic group had higher concentrations of fibrinogen and D-dimer, and lower levels of antithrombin, protein C, protein S and heparin cofactor 2 than the non-cardioembolic group. The differences in the hemostatic profile are consistent with thrombosis due to activated coagulation being more involved in the pathogenesis of cardioembolic than of non-cardioembolic stroke. Lipoprotein(a) seems to be more associated with coagulation markers of thrombosis than with atherosclerosis, whereas the other lipids mainly seem to be risk factors for atherosclerosis."

Tissue blocks from 4 predetermined areas (cingulate gyrus, frontal, parietal, and temporal lobe) were studied, irrespective of macroscopically evident MS plaques. All tissue blocks contained cerebral cortex and periventricular and/or subcortical white matter. One hundred and nine demyelinating lesions were detected in the cerebral cortex, of which 92 (84.4%) were purely intracortical and 17 (15.6%) were lesions extending through both white and gray matter areas. In 5 of the 20 MS brains, subpial demyelination was extensive in the 4 widely spaced cortical areas studied, thus considered to represent a general cortical subpial demyelination. The percentage of demyelinated area was significantly higher in the cerebral cortex (mean 26.5%, median 14.1%) than in white matter (mean 6.5%, median 0%) (p = 0.001). Both gray and white matter demyelination was more prominent in the cingulate gyrus than in the other areas examined (p < 0.05). These results indicate that the cerebral cortex is likely to be a predilection site for MS lesions and identify general cortical subpial demyelination as a distinct pattern occurring in a significant subpopulation of MS patients."
432,Reduced LPA expression after peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha) activation in LPA-YAC transgenic mice.,15837165,Pathophysiology : the official journal of the International Society for Pathophysiology. Volume: 11 Issue: 4 May 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15837165/,"BACKGROUND:: Apolipoprotein(a) (apo(a)), which is part of the atherogenic lipoprotein Lp(a), shares structural homology with plasminogen (plg). Genes coding for plasminogen (PLG) and apo(a) (LPA) are linked and situated 40kb apart in the telomeric region of the long arm of chromosome 6. LPA is naturally expressed only in primates and hedgehogs. Thus, access to knowledge regarding the mechanism by which LPA expression is regulated is limited due to shortage of appropriate animal models. However, mice transgenic for the human LPA gene have been produced. Lp(a) levels in man are genetically determined and not altered significantly by dietary changes. In contrast, mice transgenic for LPA-yeast artificial chromosome (LPA-YAC) have markedly reduced apo(a) levels after maintenance on a high-fat diet. LPA-YAC carries the 40kb LPA-PLG intergenic region, which includes a putative binding site for peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor alpha (PPARalpha). Therefore, we examined if fibrates, which exert their effect via PPARalpha, could alter LPA expression in transgenic mice. METHODS:: Two LPA transgenic mouse lines with or without the LPA-PLG intergenic region we fed either PPARalpha agonist fenofibrate (FF) or 4-chloro-6-(2,3-xylidino)-2-pyrimidinylthioacetic acid (WY 14643) containing diets for 3 weeks. For the study of serum apo(a) levels, blood were sampled prior the experiment and when the animals were sacrificed. For the study of gene expression pattern pieces of livers were collected and submerged in RNAlater buffer and stored at -70 degrees C until analysis by quantitative PCR. RESULTS AND CONCLUSIONS:: The results showed that fibrates reduce LPA expression in LPA-YAC transgenic mice, but have no impact on hepatic apo(a) mRNA or serum apo(a) protein levels in LPA-cDNA transgenic mice, which lack the LPA-PLG intergenic region. This suggests that the effect of fibrates on LPA expression is mediated upstream of the LPA gene. However, on the basis of current data it is not possible to conclude that PPARalpha is the primary factor that represses LPA expression in LPA-YAC transgenic mice. Negative correlation between FXR and apo(a) mRNA levels, in addition to putative FXR DNA binding sequence in LPA-PLG intergenic region, suggest that it is equally likely that reduced expression of LPA could be a secondary consequence of PPARalpha activation on other genes, such as FXR."

In all the patients, serum concentrations of retinol at baseline and changes in retinol were positively associated with body mass index (unstandardized regression coefficient, b = 0.03; p = 0.05) and an increase in weight (b = 0.09, p = 0.02) after dietary intervention, respectively. At baseline, serum retinol concentrations were positively correlated with forced vital capacity (b = 0.24, p < 0.05) and forced expiratory volume in one second (b = 0.17, p < 0.05). In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), tocopherols were higher in the underweight patients than in the normal-weight ones, while it was an opposite tendency in patients with other lung diseases. Only in patients with lung diseases other than COPD was there found a positive association between tocopherols and lung gas diffusion. In patients with other diagnoses compared with patients with COPD, a positive change in serum tocopherol status after weight gain was suggested."

We obtained 114 S. epidermidis isolates from the nose and 74 S. aureus from the nose and/or throat of healthy adolescents. S. aureus biofilm formation was analysed in a microtitre plate assay and the prevalence of ica, encoding biofilm formation, and esp was analysed with polymerase chain reaction (PCR). Inhibitory effects of S. epidermidis culture supernatants on S. aureus biofilm formation and growth was analysed in vitro. esp prevalence and expression was correlated with inhibitory effects. We detected biofilm formation in 45/74 (61%) S. aureus strains. The ica operon was more prevalent in isolates colonising the nose (12/15; 80%) versus isolates colonising the throat only (8/46; 17%). Almost two-thirds of S. epidermidis culture supernatants displayed high (≥ 50%) S. aureus biofilm inhibitory activity, without affecting growth. We found no correlation between the level of inhibitory activity and S. aureus colonisation. esp was ubiquitous in S. epidermidis, but esp expression did not correlate with biofilm inhibitory activity. S. epidermidis culture supernatants inhibit S. aureus biofilm formation, but do not affect bacterial growth. esp expression was not correlated with the inhibitory effects observed."

A major environmental factor is known (ingested gluten from wheat), and there is unprecedented genetic and functional evidence pinpointing HLA-DQA1*05-DQB1*02 ( DQ2) and DQA1*03-DQB1*0302 ( DQ8) in disease predisposition. We discuss the current state of play in coeliac disease genetics, focussing particularly on the HLA complex. Emerging evidence suggests that additional HLA risk loci exert weak effects, independent of DQA1*05-DQB1*02, on the B8-DR3-DQ2 haplotype. There is also good evidence from linkage studies of disease gene(s) on chromosome 5q. We discuss the role and implications of linkage disequilibrium and haplotype blocks in complex disease gene mapping. We briefly address findings from studies of animal models for chronic inflammatory disease, and consider roles for both common genes associated with multiple inflammatory diseases, and genes unique to coeliac disease. The coeliac genetics research community has established a sound foundation for the identification of additional disease genes in the not-too-distant future. Functional studies will play a critical role, and coeliac disease has a promising future in this respect. Coeliac disease continues to function as a model disorder, facilitating the development and implementation of complex disease gene mapping strategies."

Comparable analytical sensitivities were obtained with detection at 230 nm with a conventional deuterium lamp spectrophotometer and a photometer equipped with a cadmium emission source, while with a diode-array spectrophotometer, signal-to-noise ratios were reduced with factors between 4.4 and 3.1, depending on the spectral bandwidth of the instrument. Theoretical aspects of signal-to-noise optimization of ultraviolet detectors are discussed. The stability of dilute standard solutions of PGE2 and PGD2 was measured, showing solutions in dichloromethane at 20 degrees C to be as stable as acetonitrile solutions at 5 degrees C over a period of thirty days. Absolute ethanol and acetonitrile were equally suited as solvents."

MenBvac is prepared from a B:15:P1.7,16 meningococcal strain (strain 44/76), and MeNZB is prepared from a B:4:P1.7-2,4 strain (strain NZ98/254). At 6-week intervals, healthy adults received three doses of MenBvac (25 microg), MeNZB (25 microg), or the MenBvac and MeNZB (doses of 12.5 microg of each vaccine) vaccines combined, followed by a booster 1 year later. Two-thirds of the subjects who received a monovalent vaccine in the primary schedule received the other monovalent vaccine as a booster dose. The immune responses to the combined vaccine were of the same magnitude as the homologous responses to each individual vaccine observed. At 6 weeks after the third dose, 77% and 87% of the subjects in the combined vaccine group achieved serum bactericidal titers of > or = 4 against strains 44/76 and NZ98/254, respectively, and 97% and 93% of the subjects achieved a fourfold or greater increase in opsonophagocytic activity against strains 44/76 and NZ98/254, respectively. For both strains, a trend of higher responses after the booster dose was observed in all groups receiving at least one dose of the respective strain-specific vaccine. Local and systemic reactions were common in all vaccine groups. Most reactions were mild or moderate in intensity, and there were no vaccine-related serious adverse events. The safety profile of the combined vaccine was not different from those of the separate monovalent vaccines. In conclusion, use of either of the single vaccines or the combination of MenBvac and MeNZB may have a considerable impact on the serogroup B meningococcal disease situation in many countries."

Volume: 54 Issue: 19 Oct 01 2016",2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27840558/,"Determination of molecular masses of charged polymers is often nontrivial and most methods have their drawbacks. For polyelectrolytes, a new possibility for the determination of number-average molecular masses is represented by small-angle X-ray scattering (SAXS) which allows fast determinations with a 10% accuracy. This is done by relating the mass to the position of a characteristic peak feature which arises in SAXS due to the local ordering caused by charge-repulsions between polyelectrolytes. Advantages of the technique are the simplicity of data analysis, the independency from polymer architecture, and the low sample and time consumption. The method was tested on polyelectrolytes of various structures and chemical compositions, and the results were compared with those obtained from more conventional techniques, such as asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation, gel permeation chromatography, and classical SAXS data analysis, showing that the accuracy of the suggested method is similar to that of the other techniques. © 2016 The Authors.

In addition, we show how the spatial characteristics of multichannel surface electromyography can be used to obtain single-surface motor unit potentials. The possibilities, challenges, and problems are discussed. Finally, several examples of surface motor unit potential analyses are given."

The staff at the local mental hospital to a large extent controlled the number of admissions. Lack of cooperation from part of the staff made a greater reduction of admissions difficult. It is argued that in order to achieve a true shift from institutional to community psychiatry, the use of the hospital beds should be monitored from the community level."

Volume: 123 Issue: 4 Oct 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29753315/,"Potentially inappropriate prescriptions (PIP) is drug treatment, which in general, at the group level for a median/mean patient, can be considered unfavourable meaning that the risks commonly may outweigh the benefits. This MiniReview reports and discusses the main findings in a large cluster-randomized educational intervention in Norwegian general practice, aimed at reducing the prevalence of PIPs to patients ≥70 years (The Rx-PAD study). Targets for the intervention were general practitioners (GPs) in continuing medical education (CME) groups receiving educational outreach visits (i.e. peer academic detailing). A Delphi consensus process, with a panel of medical experts, was undertaken to elaborate a list of explicit criteria defining PIPs for patients ≥70 years in general practice. Agreement was achieved for 36 explicit PIP criteria, the so-called Norwegian General Practice (NorGeP) criteria. Using a selection (n = 24) of these criteria during a 1-year baseline period on the prescribing practice of 454 GPs (i.e. those enrolled to participate in the intervention trial), we found a prevalence rate of 24.7 PIPs per 100 patients ≥70 years per year. In the Rx-PAD study, 449 GPs completed an educational intervention (96.6% of the included GPs), 250 in the intervention group and 199 in the control arm. Following the intervention, PIPs were reduced by 13% (95% CI 8.6-17.3), and the number of patients who were no longer exposed to one or more PIPs was reduced by 1173 (8.1%). The GPs who responded most strongly to the educational intervention were the oldest GPs (57-68 years), and these were the GPs with the highest prevalence of PIPs at baseline before the intervention."

We find that a spherical particle model can be used to determine the extinction and scattering cross sections, the single-scattering albedo, and the asymmetry parameter with an error of less than 2%, whereas the extinction-to-backscatter ratio Reb is reproduced only with an error of 9%. The cylindrical and spheroidal particle models yield slightly improved results for Reb that deviate from those obtained for the complex particle ensemble by 7% and 5%, respectively. Large discrepancies between results of the different models are observed for the linear depolarization ratio, thus indicating limitations of models based on simple particle shapes."

The herd reproductive performance (time to first calving, calving interval, and number of breeding services) was investigated for a potential effect of BVDV sero-conversion. The herd culling pattern--possibly affecting the above measurements--was included for investigation. Two different statistical models were used: the generalised estimating equation (GEE) method and multilevel modelling using Gibbs sampling. Though slightly different estimates resulted, both models agreed on an effect of BVDV in the second year after sero-conversion on the herd average time to first calving by--on an average-- 14-16 days. In subsets of case herds testing positive for BVDV antibodies among young stock, the impact on time to first calving tended to be more pronounced by an additional increase of 18 days. No effect on the number of breeding services for heifers or cows was observed (indicating a need to search for other determinants than reduced conception risk). There appeared to be no effect of BVDV on the herd average calving interval. There was a tendency for a higher risk for reporting animals lost/died in sero-converted herds, which we believe might be related to the occurrence of mucosal disease."

Volume: 29 Issue: 8 Dec 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23974908/,"Pocket-size imaging devices may represent a tool for fast initial cardiac screening in the emergency setting. Pocket-size cardiac ultrasound (PCU) examinations performed by experienced echocardiographers yield acceptable diagnostic accuracy compared to standard echocardiogram (SE). However, the success of this method when used by unselected non-cardiologists remains unexplored. The current study studies the diagnostic accuracy of PCU when used by unselected internal medicine residents with minimal training. All residents were given a 2-hour introductory course in PCU (Vscan) and reported PCU results for up to 15 predefined cardiac landmarks. These were arbitrarily divided into 3 priority groups, such that left ventricle (LV) and pericardium were of first priority. Diagnostic accuracy [sensitivity/specificity and negative/positive predictive values (PPV/NPV)] and agreement were evaluated using a subsequent SE as reference. During a 9.2 months period a total of 303 patients were included in the study, the majority on the basis of presenting with chest pain or suspected heart failure. In the pooled LV and pericardial (1st priority) data, sensitivity/specificity/PPV/NPV were 61/92/70/89% respectively. Similar specificities and NPVs were observed for the 11 remaining indices, as were lower sensitivities and PPVs. The best PCU sensitivity (76%) was attained for the assessment of LV wall motion abnormalities. Overall agreement was k = 0.50. PCU examination performed by internal medicine residents with minimal training could provide a suitable means of ruling out cardiac pathology, as reflected in the high specificities and NPVs. It is not, however, a satisfactory tool for identifying patients with various cardiac disorders."

Data from Norwegian counties on numbers of medical specialists in secondary care over a period of 11 years (1991-2001) allow us to analyse effects of economic, socioeconomic, and political factors on supply of both public and private specialists and the private-public mix. We find striking variations between the main explanatory factors related to public and private supply. Supply of public specialists is explained by counties' revenue levels and demographic factors and is not affected by the party composition of councils. The supply of private specialist medical services is negatively related to the proportion of elderly patients. The scarcity hypothesis is confirmed as lower county revenue levels increase both the absolute and relative proportions of private supply. Political composition of councils affects the private proportion of medical specialists as increased representation of conservatives leads to privatization."
450,Evaluating the properties of the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC) for kinematic gait data.,22673759,Journal of biomechanics. Volume: 45 Issue: 11 Jul 26 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22673759/,"When assessing reliability of three dimensional gait analysis, the coefficient of multiple correlation (CMC), a measure of similarity of waveforms, is frequently used. Several shortcomings of the method have been reported. It is strongly related to the range of motion (ROM); it is supposed to take values from 0 to 1, but is known to obtain complex values and break down. Removing offset before calculations appears to make it insensitive to apparent differences in gait. In the present work we use stochastic simulations to demonstrate why all of this happens, and the consequences thereof. We also demonstrate other, lesser-known, issues with the method, such as the strong dependency on number of subjects and test situations. The results are demonstrated on real data from an inter-rater repeatability study. We conclude that the CMC in its current form is generally unsuitable as a tool for assessing reliability in kinematic gait data."

We examined the reproductive health of daughters of diabetic women using linked generation data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway.

A total of 142904 daughters delivered at least one child by 1998. After taking into account differences in survival, we observed no differences in the percentage of childbearing and in the average number of children born by 1998 between daughters with and without a diabetic mother in age-stratified analyses. In analyses limited to singleton deliveries and stratified by mothers' and daughters' diabetic status, we found a threefold excess stillbirth delivery rate among women who had either a mother with pregestational diabetes (2.6%) or pregestational diabetes themselves (2.6%) compared with the stillbirth delivery rate observed in non-diabetic women with no maternal history of diabetes (0.8%). These findings were unaltered in multivariable analyses adjusting for daughters' maternal age and registered obstetric risk factors. Our results indicate that pregestational diabetes remains a health care challenge in Norway and that further evaluation of the reproductive health of daughters of diabetic pregnancies is warranted."

K-mean cluster analysis was applied to partition a sample of 128 patients, 101 with various PDs and 27 with axis I disorders only, into four groups representing different courses. The course was defined on the basis of global functioning (Health Sickness Rating Scale [HSRS]) at admission, discharge, and 3-years follow-up evaluation. The four courses were labeled good, fair, late improvement, and poor, demonstrating great variation in the short-term course among patients with PDs. Predictors were studied by means of polychotomous logistic regression using the patients with a fair course as the reference group. The dichotomy no PD/cluster C versus cluster A/B predicted a good versus a fair course. A poor work status the last year before admission and irregular discharge predicted a poor or late improvement course versus a fair course, also when controlling for PD clusters. None of the included variables discriminated between patients with a poor versus late improvement course."

One dominating fraction, designated Frazer III-2-VIII, was purified by several steps of rechromatography. It was markedly toxic to duodenal explants from patients with active celiac disease. The mean enterocyte height after culture was 15.9 microns compared with 25.6 microns in gluten-free medium. This difference was statistically significant in all cases except one, in which the lowest concentration (110 micrograms) was used. The in vitro toxicity of Frazer III-2-VIII was comparable with the toxicity of alpha-gliadin in twofold to fivefold higher concentrations. No toxicity could be detected in nonceliac explants (mean enterocyte height, 25.7 vs. 24.9 microns in gluten-free medium). The N-terminal amino acid sequence was (Gln)-Ile-Gln-Val-Phe-Pro-Ser-Gly-Gln-Val-Gln-(Trp)-Pro-Gln-Gln-(Gln)-Gl n-Pro- Phe-Pro.

Teeth develop via reciprocal and sequential interactions between the epithelium and the ectomesenchyme. The speci.c functions of several genes during tooth development are known, and the involvement of their mutations in the pathogenesis of congenital dental defects has been widely studied. The miRNA pathway is considered to have a significant role in embryogenesis including tooth development. It has been shown that miRNAs regulate morphogenesis of tooth by fine-tuning the signalling networks, however, their precise role in tooth differentiation and morphogenesis is still elusive. The present review focuses on the studies that have used animal models to explore the function of miRNAs in tooth development. Major findings with special emphasis on the miRNA involvement in .ne-tuning and network regulation are presented and discussed. Disturbances in tooth development in the global miRNA processing knockouts mirror the essential fine-tuning guiding appropriate formation of dental hard tissues. However, further investigation of single miRNA function and mutation, including deletion and overexpression, may lead to improved knowledge on development of particular dental defects in humans. In the light of similarities between tooth development and other organs originating from the epithelium, further understanding of miRNAs` function during tooth development may have wide biological relevance."

The reasons are explored in this 5-year trial update using both survival analysis and competing risk analysis on non-CLL-related mortality. Elderly FCA patients died more frequently from causes not related to CLL, and more often related to comorbidity (mostly cardiovascular) than to infection. In a Cox multivariate analysis, del(17p), performance status >0, and comorbidity were associated with a higher non-CLL-related mortality in the elderly independent of the treatment modality. Thus, while the 'fit' elderly with no comorbidity or performance status of 0 might potentially benefit from chemo-immunotherapy with FC, caution is warranted, when considering alemtuzumab treatment in elderly patients with cardiovascular comorbidity."

The horses were exercised daily at medium level for about 1 h. Samples were analysed for short-chain fatty acids (SCFA) and metabolic traits. Caecal SCFA and propionic acid concentrations increased with increased dietary starch and soluble fibre. The diet highest in soluble fibre (M) resulted in the highest plasma glucose and insulin concentrations in the morning, which then remained stable and constant throughout the day. A strong interaction (P<0.01) between time and diet was measured for plasma urea, glucose, insulin and leptin. The greatest variations in plasma glycaemic and insulinaemic responses were associated with the cereal grain diets (OB and BB). There were indications of a negative energy balance, which was reflected in a significantly higher plasma β-hydroxybutyrate concentration and a numerically higher non-esterified fatty acid concentration. In conclusion, this study found that inclusion of soluble fibre resulted in increased total caecal SCFA and propionic acid concentrations. This consequently resulted in stable and constant plasma glycaemic and insulinaemic responses. Diets with a high content of soluble fibre provided enough energy for horses at medium work level. "
467,Effects of the sulphydryl inhibitor N-ethyl-maleimide on the phrenic nerve and diaphragm muscle of the rat.,2571100,Neuropharmacology. Volume: 28 Issue: 8 Aug 1989,1989,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2571100/,"N-Ethyl-maleimide (NEM, 2.5 x 10(-5) M) inhibited the compound action potential of the phrenic nerve and increased the spontaneous release of transmitter from the nerve terminals, recorded as miniature endplate potentials. The first effect was the cause of a blockade of the phrenic nerve diaphragm preparation, during indirect stimulation. The left phrenic nerve was more susceptible to inhibition than the right. An increase of the threshold was observed during the progression of the inhibition. The inhibition was not use-dependent and there was no synergistic interaction with the local anaesthetic drug, tetracaine. The inhibition was partly antagonized by di-thio-threitol (3.0 x 10(-3) M). The increase of spontaneous release of transmitter was not accompanied by an increase of the stimulus-evoked release since the amplitude of the endplate potential was not increased and partial inhibition caused by d-tubocurarine or magnesium chloride was not antagonized. When the concentration of NEM was increased to 2.75 x 10(-4) M, the directly-elicited twitches were inhibited, and the baseline tension was increased. This increase of tension was slightly reduced in a preparation depolarized with potassium chloride; a small depolarization could partly explain this effect. It was not reduced by dantrolene or in a calcium-free solution. The inhibition of the twitch and the increased baseline tension (probably a rigor) might be caused by a reduced sensitivity of the contractile proteins for calcium ions and an inhibition of the myosin ATPase activity, respectively."
468,Should kidneys from older cadaveric donors be age-matched to the recipient?,16298572,Transplantation proceedings. Volume: 37 Issue: 8 Oct 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16298572/,"Persistent shortage of kidneys for transplantation has forced most transplant centers to include procurement and use of kidneys from older donors. It is not clear whether the optimal use of these kidneys involve age-matching to the recipient. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical outcome of older cadaveric kidneys (>60 years), transplanted to young recipients (<50 years) and older recipients (>60 years). From 1989 through 2002, 252 first kidney grafts were procured from donors above the age of 60; 149 of the recipients to these grafts were above 60 years and 45 recipients were below 50. Minimum follow-up time was 12 months. Variables for waiting time to transplantation, DR mismatches, PRA, dialysis prior to transplantation, episodes of acute rejection, number of steroid-resistant rejections, creatinine levels, cold ischemia time, and causes of graft loss did not differ between the two groups. There was no significant difference in graft survival for young and older recipients receiving kidney from donors above 60 years of age. Graft survival at 1 year for young recipients was 90% and for older recipients 93% (NS). Five-year graft survival was 72% and 79%, respectively (NS). However, there was a significant positive effect on long-term graft survival if the donor kidney was less than 50 years. From our data, there is no evidence that age-matching of older donors has any beneficial effect on graft survival in kidney transplantation."

Volume: 82 Issue: Pt 8 Aug 2001,2001,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11457987/,"An emerging amount of data indicates a correlation between gender-related factors and regulation of virus infection and supports what is known in clinical circles, that these topics are of great importance in many infectious diseases. In the present study we found that young adult NMRI male mice are more susceptible to infection by a variant of Friend murine leukaemia virus, FIS-2, than are female mice. We observed that the level of virus in serum, bone marrow and spleen was initially higher in male mice. Male mice were also more susceptible to FIS-2-induced immunosuppression. These results indicate a more efficient virus replication and dissemination in male mice. Studies with recombinant viruses between FIS-2 and the prototype Friend murine leukaemia virus revealed that FIS-2 LTR is one major factor contributing to the observed gender differences. A possible sex hormone influence on FIS-2 transcription due to the presence of a glucocorticoid response element in FIS-2 LTR is discussed."
470,Hepatic and abdominal carbon dioxide measurements detect and distinguish hepatic artery occlusion and portal vein occlusion in pigs.,22961940,Liver transplantation : official publication of the American Association for the Study of Liver Diseases and the International Liver Transplantation Society. Volume: 18 Issue: 12 Dec 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22961940/,"Hepatic artery (HA) occlusion and portal vein (PV) occlusion are the most common vascular complications after liver transplantation with an impact on mortality and retransplantation rates. The detection of severe hypoperfusion may be delayed with currently available diagnostic tools. Hypoperfusion and anaerobically produced lactic acid lead to increases in tissue carbon dioxide. We investigated whether the continuous assessment of the intrahepatic and intra-abdominal partial pressure of carbon dioxide (PCO(2) ) could be used to detect and distinguish HA and PV occlusions in real time. In 13 pigs, the HA and the PV were fully occluded (n = 7) or gradually occluded (n = 6). PCO(2) was monitored intrahepatically and between loops of small intestine. The hepatic and intestinal metabolism was assessed with microdialysis and PV as well as hepatic vein blood samples, and the results were compared to clinical parameters for the systemic circulation and blood gas analysis. Total HA occlusion led to significant increases in hepatic PCO(2) and lactate, and this was accompanied by significant decreases in the partial pressure of oxygen and glucose. PV occlusion induced a significant increase in intestinal PCO(2) (but not hepatic PCO(2) ) along with significant increases in intestinal lactate and glycerol. Gradual HA occlusion and PV occlusion caused steady hepatic and intestinal PCO(2) increases, respectively. Systemic clinical parameters such as the blood pressure, heart rate, and cardiac output were affected only by PV occlusion. In conclusion, even gradual HA occlusion affects liver metabolism and can be reliably identified with hepatic PCO(2) measurements. Intestinal PCO(2) increases only during PV occlusion. A combination of hepatic and intestinal PCO(2) measurements can reliably diagnose the affected vessel and depict the severity of the occlusion, and this may emerge as a potential real-time clinical monitoring tool for the postoperative course of liver transplantation and enable early interventions."
471,"Molecular characterization and expression of FSHbeta, LHbeta, and common alpha-subunit in male Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus).",12679085,General and comparative endocrinology. Volume: 131 Issue: 2 Apr 2003,2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12679085/,"To elucidate the role of the gonadotropins in the multiple spawner Atlantic halibut (Hippoglossus hippoglossus) full length cDNAs encoding FSHbeta, LHbeta, and the common alpha-subunit were cloned from pituitary glands by RACE-PCR. The three cDNAs consisted of 614, 595, and 666 nucleotides encoding peptides of 131, 146, and 124 amino acids, respectively. Halibut FSHbeta and LHbeta showed unique structural features among the vertebrate glycoprotein hormones. First, in contrast to all known FSHbeta, which contain either one or two conserved N-glycosylation sites, no potential binding site was found in Atlantic halibut FSHbeta. Second, the conserved glycosylation site in the N-terminus of all vertebrate LHbeta has been substituted with a unique C-terminal binding site in Atlantic halibut LHbeta. Furthermore, a specific cysteine residue of importance for the folding and heterodimerization of mammalian FSH is lacking in the FSHbeta from Atlantic halibut as well as many other teleosts. However, teleost FSHbeta is characterized by an additional N-terminal cysteine, which has likely replaced the missing residue, implicating a modified folding pattern of this subunit. In situ hybridization of mature male pituitaries revealed that FSHbeta and LHbeta mRNA were expressed in distinct cell types throughout the proximal pars distalis of the adenohypophysis, while alpha-subunit mRNA was identified in all parts of the proximal pars distalis, and also along the periphery of pars intermedia. Consistently, Northern blot analysis of pituitary RNA from mature males showed that FSHbeta, LHbeta, and alpha-subunit mRNAs were highly expressed. In juvenile male pituitaries very few cells containing FSHbeta, LHbeta, and alpha-subunit mRNA were identified by in situ hybridization. Low mRNA levels encoding LHbeta and the alpha-subunit were also demonstrated by Northern blot analysis of the juvenile pituitaries, while no FSHbeta mRNA was detected using this less sensitive technique. The results suggest that both FSH and LH play a role during both the very early and the final reproductive stages in Atlantic halibut males."

A better understanding of the tumor metabolism might help us meet the challenges in controlling brain metastases. The study aims to characterize the metabolic profile of brain metastases of different origin using high resolution magic angle spinning (HR-MAS) magnetic resonance spectroscopy (MRS) to correlate the metabolic profiles to clinical and pathological information. Biopsy samples of human brain metastases (n = 49) were investigated. A significant correlation between lipid signals and necrosis in brain metastases was observed (p < 0.01), irrespective of their primary origin. The principal component analysis (PCA) showed that brain metastases from malignant melanomas cluster together, while lung carcinomas were metabolically heterogeneous and overlap with other subtypes. Metastatic melanomas have higher amounts of glycerophosphocholine than other brain metastases. A significant correlation between microscopically visible lipid droplets estimated by Nile Red staining and MR visible lipid signals was observed in metastatic lung carcinomas (p = 0.01), indicating that the proton MR visible lipid signals arise from cytoplasmic lipid droplets. MRS-based metabolomic profiling is a useful tool for exploring the metabolic profiles of metastatic brain tumors."

Volume: 147 Issue: 17 Nov 07 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29117685/,"The NMR chemical shifts and indirect spin-spin coupling constants of 12 molecules containing 29Si, 73Ge, 119Sn, and 207Pb [X(CCMe)4, Me2X(CCMe)2, and Me3XCCH] are presented. The results are obtained from non-relativistic as well as two- and four-component relativistic density functional theory (DFT) calculations. The scalar and spin-orbit relativistic contributions as well as the total relativistic corrections are determined. The main relativistic effect in these molecules is not due to spin-orbit coupling but rather to the scalar relativistic contraction of the s-shells. The correlation between the calculated and experimental indirect spin-spin coupling constants showed that the four-component relativistic density functional theory (DFT) approach using the Perdew's hybrid scheme exchange-correlation functional (PBE0; using the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof exchange and correlation functionals) gives results in good agreement with experimental values. The indirect spin-spin coupling constants calculated using the spin-orbit zeroth order regular approximation together with the hybrid PBE0 functional and the specially designed J-coupling (JCPL) basis sets are in good agreement with the results obtained from the four-component relativistic calculations. For the coupling constants involving the heavy atoms, the relativistic corrections are of the same order of magnitude compared to the non-relativistically calculated results. Based on the comparisons of the calculated results with available experimental values, the best results for all the chemical shifts and non-existing indirect spin-spin coupling constants for all the molecules are reported, hoping that these accurate results will be used to benchmark future DFT calculations. The present study also demonstrates that the four-component relativistic DFT method has reached a level of maturity that makes it a convenient and accurate tool to calculate indirect spin-spin coupling constants of ""large"" molecular systems involving heavy atoms."

Important virulence factors are the Shiga toxins (stx), encoded by stx1 and/or stx2 located within prophages integrated in the bacterial genome. The stx genes are expressed from p(R)             (')  as a late protein, and anti-terminator activity from the Q protein is necessary for read through of the late terminator t(R)             (')  and activation of p(R)             (') . We investigated the regulation of stx2(EDL933)  expression at the genomic level in 17 Norwegian SF O157. Sequencing of three selected SF O157 strains revealed that the anti-terminator q gene and genes upstream of stx2(EDL933)  were identical or similar to the ones observed in the E. coli O111:H- strain AP010960, but different from the ones observed in the NSF O157 strain EDL933 (AE005174). This suggested divergent stx2(EDL933) -encoding bacteriophages between NSF O157 and the SF O157 strains (FR874039-41). Furthermore, different DNA structures were detected in the SF O157 strains, suggesting diversity among bacteriophages also within the SF O157 group. Further investigations are needed to elucidate whether the q(O111:H)             (-)  gene observed in all our SF O157 contributes to the increased virulence seen in SF O157 compared to NSF O157.

To cover the demand for fish in the growing human population, continued high growth rates in aquaculture are needed. A potential constraint to such growth is infectious diseases, as disease transmission rates are expected to increase with increasing densities of farmed fish. Using an extensive dataset from all farms growing salmonids along the Norwegian coast, we document that densities of farmed salmonids surrounding individual farms have a strong effect on farm levels of parasitic sea lice and efforts to control sea lice infections. Furthermore, increased intervention efforts have been unsuccessful in controlling elevated infection levels in high salmonid density areas in 2009-2010. Our results emphasize host density effects of farmed salmonids on the population dynamics of sea lice and suggest that parasitic sea lice represent a potent negative feedback mechanism that may limit sustainable spatial densities of farmed salmonids."

Volume: 44 Issue: 10 Oct 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17021100/,"The role of atypical enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC) in childhood diarrhea is controversial. The aim of the present study was to search for genes linked with diarrhea in atypical EPEC strains from a case-control study among Norwegian children. Using DNA microarray analysis, genomic DNAs from strains isolated from children with (n = 37) and without (n = 20) diarrhea were hybridized against 242 different oligonucleotide probes specific for 182 virulence genes or markers from all known E. coli pathotypes. PCR was performed to test the strains for seven putative virulence genes not included in the microarray panel. The OI-122 gene efa1/lifA was the gene with the strongest statistical association with diarrhea (P = 0.0008). Other OI-122 genes (set/ent, nleB, and nleE) and genes with other locations (lpfA, paa, ehxA, and ureD) were also associated with diarrheal disease. The phylogenetic marker gene yjaA was negatively associated with diarrhea (P = 0.0004). Atypical EPEC strains could be classified in two main virulence groups based on their content of OI-122, lpfA, and yjaA genes. Among children with diarrhea, atypical EPEC isolates belonging to virulence group I (OI-122 and lpfA positive, yjaA negative) were the most common, while the majority of isolates from healthy children were classified as virulence group II strains (OI-122 negative, lpfA and yjaA positive; P < 0.001). In conclusion, using DNA microarray analysis to determine the virulence gene profile of atypical EPEC isolates, several genes were found to be significantly associated with diarrhea. Based on their composition of virulence genes, the majority of strains could be classified in two virulence groups, of which one was seen mainly in children with diarrhea."

Volume: 113 Issue: 3 Nov 2001,2001,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12060277/,"The environmental control of dormancy and flowering of the herbaceous perennial Sedum telephium was studied in controlled environments. Short photoperiods induced growth cessation and the formation of resting buds in both seedlings and mature plants, whereas long photoperiods resulted in immediate growth activation of dormant buds. No chilling was required for dormancy release, even in plants induced to dormancy and maintained at high temperature (21 degrees C) for more than 3 months. The critical photoperiod for dormancy release was about 15 h, a minimum of four long-day (LD) cycles (24 h) being required. The true photoperiodic nature of this response was ascertained by night interruption experiments. Flowering of S. telephium was found to have an obligatory LD requirement, with no requirement for vernalization. The critical photoperiod and minimum number of inductive cycles for floral induction were the same as for dormancy release. Dormancy release by long days was also obtained in preliminary experiments with three other herbaceous perennials. The eco-physiological significance of photoperiodic control of dormancy is discussed, and it is concluded that the mechanism ensures stability of winter dormancy, even under conditions of climatic warming."

All calves were inoculated epicutaneously with a virulent strain of Trichophyton verrucosum. Clinical signs were recorded. In response to stimulation with trichophytin, in vitro interferon-gamma (IFN-gamma) production in whole blood cell cultures was assessed in samples obtained pre- and post-vaccination and pre- and post-inoculation. A commercial enzyme immunoas                say kit was used to measure IFN-gamma levels (Bovigam, CSL, Victoria, Australia). Control calves developed typical ringworm lesions, whereas vaccinated calves did not. Following vaccination, release of IFN-gamma in whole blood cell cultures indicated the presence of circulating trichophytin-specific lymphocytes. After inoculation with T. verrucosum, IFN-gamma production was demonstrated in samples from both vaccinated and control calves. This study showed that vaccination with Ringvac bovis LTF-130 elicits a protective immune response suggesting involvement of the cellular branch of the immune system. Experimental infection of naïve nonvaccinated calves with T. verrucosum, also indicated stimulation of a cell-mediated immune response essential for resolution of lesions."

Five-year survival rates for patients with PF, ST and IS tumors were 28%, 0% and 100%, respectively. Total tumor resection was a positive prognostic factor in the case of PF tumors. No patients with subtotal removal of a PF tumor survived for longer than 5 years. The effect of RT on survival of patients with PF ependymomas in this series was uncertain. No patients with PF ependymoma had disseminated disease at diagnosis, and all tumor recurrences were local. Based on these observations, we see no indications for craniospinal RT of PF ependymomas, except in rare cases of disseminated disease. If RT is given, it should only be targeted to the tumor site. The two patients with ST ependymoma died within 3.8 years after primary treatment. Our series of ST ependymomas does not allow any specific treatment recommendations. One patient with IS ependymoma was cured by surgery alone. Four patients with IS ependymoma had documented residual tumor after surgery. RT induced remission in these patients. For IS ependymomas we recommend no RT if total tumor removal can be documented. In patients with subtotal removal of IS ependymomas local RT is effective and should be given."

Serum hCG levels on days 14, 16, 20 and 27 following ovulation induction with hCG were examined. Serum hCG values were significantly lower in early gestation in IVF compared with AIH, but no difference in hCG doubling times was observed. No difference in serum hCG values between IVF treatment with or without gonadotropin-releasing hormone agonist (GnRHa) was observed. Significantly lower hCG values but no difference in doubling times in early gestation in IVF compared with AIH may be explained by late but successful implantation in IVF. The mechanism for this assumed late implantation is not clear. Altered endometrial receptivity or factors of embryonic origin might explain the observed variation in hCG values and the assumed late implantation."

Volume: 76 Issue: 3 Jun 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17069920/,"One of the major public health challenges of the 21st century is type 2 diabetes. WHO estimates that by 2025 as many as 200-300 million people worldwide will have developed the disease. A distressing increase in children is perhaps the most alarming sign of something going wrong. Roughly half of the risk of type 2 diabetes can be attributed to environmental exposure and the other half to genetics. Central themes for prevention are the risk factors overweight, sedentary lifestyle, certain dietary components and perinatal factors. Overweight is the most critical risk factor, and should be targeted for prevention of type 2 diabetes especially among children and youths. Ethnicity and perinatal factors are also worth considering. Today we know that prevention helps. In the US Diabetes Prevention Programme for high risk individuals, there was a 58% relative reduction in the progression to diabetes in the lifestyle group compared with the controls. Within the lifestyle group, 50% achieved the goal of more than 7% weight reduction, and 74% maintained at least 150 min of moderately intense activity each week. This review discusses different forms of prevention, and proposes first of all to target people with Impaired Glucose Tolerance with increasing activity and altering dietary factors. And secondly, population-based measures to encourage increased physical activity and decreased consumption of energy-dense foods are important, and may target school children and young people, certain ethnic groups and women with gestational diabetes."

Most of the symbiotic strains fell into well separated clades. One clade consisted of a mixture of symbiotic and free-living isolates. This clade includes Nostoc sp. strain PCC 73102, the reference strain proposed for Nostoc punctiforme. A separate symbiotic clade with isolates exclusively from Gunnera species was also obtained, suggesting that not all symbiotic Nostoc species can be assigned to N. punctiforme. Moreover, isolates from Azolla filiculoides and one from Gunnera dentata were well nested within a clade comprising most of the Anabaena sequences. This result supports the affiliation of the Azolla isolates with the genus Anabaena and shows that strains within this genus can form symbioses with additional hosts. Furthermore, these symbiotic strains produced hormogonia, thereby verifying that hormogonia formation is not absent in Anabaena and cannot be used as a criterion to distinguish it from Nostoc."

Volume: 114 Issue: 5 May 2006",2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16725013/,"Previous reports have shown that genistein and tyrphostin AG-1478, two tyrosine kinase inhibitors (TKIs), exert multiple cellular effects in prostate carcinoma cells, e.g. a reduction in the production of urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA) and its receptor uPAR, and a decrease in the cells' ability to invade an artificial basement membrane. Microarray technology was used to measure alterations in mRNA levels caused by TKI treatment in two prostatic carcinoma cell lines, PC-3 and DU-145. Genistein treatment led to a reduction of at least 50% in 78 genes in PC-3, while 82 were twofold upregulated. In DU-145, the same treatment resulted in a 50% decreased transcript level in 120 genes, and increased expression in 25 genes. Tyrphostin AG-1478 produced a 50% reduction in mRNA levels in 58 genes in DU-145, whereas no alterations were demonstrated using the tyrphostin in PC-3 cells. Among the effects of TKIs, a lowered uPA and uPAR transcription was demonstrated in genistein-treated cells, while a few metalloproteinases (MMPs) were affected. Transcription of various integrin subunits was also downregulated overall. Several alterations in gene transcription were demonstrated in PC-3 and DU-145 after TKI treatment. This knowledge could be of importance in the search for new therapeutic strategies in prostate cancer treatment, and the interplay between the various effects needs to be investigated further."
513,Hypoxia-induced treatment failure in advanced squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix is primarily due to hypoxia-induced radiation resistance rather than hypoxia-induced metastasis.,10917551,British journal of cancer. Volume: 83 Issue: 3 Aug 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10917551/,"Poor outcome of treatment in advanced cervix carcinoma has been shown to be associated with poor oxygenation of the primary tumour. Hypoxia may cause radiation resistance and promote lymph-node metastasis. The purpose of the study reported here was to investigate whether hypoxia-induced treatment failure in advanced cervix carcinoma is primarily a result of hypoxia-induced radiation resistance or the presence of hypoxia-induced lymph-node metastases at the start of treatment. Thirty-two patients with squamous cell carcinoma of the uterine cervix were included in the study. Radiation therapy was given with curative intent as combined external irradiation and endocavitary brachytherapy. The oxygenation status of the primary tumour was measured prior to treatment using the Eppendorf PO2 Histograph. Pelvic and para-aortal lymph-node metastases were detected by magnetic resonance imaging at the time of initial diagnosis. The primary tumours of the patients with metastases (n = 18) were significantly more poorly oxygenated than those of the patients without metastases (n = 14). Multivariate Cox regression analyses involving biological and clinical parameters identified the tumour subvolume having PO2 values below 5 mmHg (HSV (pO2 < 5 mmHg) as the only significant, independent prognostic factor for locoregional control, disease-free survival and overall survival. The probabilities of locoregional control, disease-free survival and overall survival were significantly lower for the patients with HSV (PO2 < 5 mmHg) above the median value than for those with HSV (PO2 < 5 mmHg) below the median value. On the other hand, the outcome of treatment was not significantly different for the patients with metastases and the patients without metastases at the start of treatment, irrespective of clinical end-point. Consequently, treatment failure was primarily a result of hypoxia-induced radiation resistance rather than hypoxia-induced lymph-node metastasis, suggesting that novel treatment strategies aiming at improving tumour oxygenation or enhancing the radiation sensitivity of hypoxic tumour cells may prove beneficial in attempts to improve the radiation therapy of advanced cervix carcinoma."

Volume: 214 Issue: 1 Feb 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18258772/,"The appendicularian urochordate Oikopleura dioica retains a free-swimming chordate body plan throughout life, in contrast to ascidian urochordates, whose metamorphosis to a sessile adult form involves the loss of chordate structures such as the notochord and dorsal nerve cord. Development to adult stages in Oikopleura involves a lengthening of the tail and notochord and an elaboration of the repertoire of tail movements. To investigate the cellular basis for this lengthening, we have used confocal microscopy and BrdU labeling to examine the development of the Oikopleura notochord from hatching through adult stages. We show that as the notochord undergoes the typical urochordate transition from a stacked row of cells to a tubular structure, cell number begins to increase. Addition of new notochord cells continues into adulthood, multiplying the larval complement of 20 cells by about 8-fold by the third day of life. In parallel, the notochord lengthens by about 4-fold. BrdU incorporation and a cell-cycle marker confirm that notochord cells continue to proliferate well into adulthood. The extensive postlarval proliferation of notochord cells, together with their arrangement in four circumferentially distributed longitudinal rows, presumably provides the Oikopleura tail with the necessary mechanical support for the complex movements exhibited at adult stages."

Volume: 45 Issue: 3 Mar 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25431272/,"The aim of the present study was to analyse the interaction between asthma and smoking in the risk of adult airway obstruction, accounting for atopy. In the European Community Respiratory Health Survey, 15 668 persons aged 20-56 years underwent spirometry in 1991-1993 and 9 years later (n=8916). Risk of airway obstruction and lung function decline associated with smoking and early-onset (<10 years of age) and late-onset (>10 years of age) asthma were analysed with generalised estimating equation models and random-effect linear models, adjusting for covariates. Interaction of asthma with smoking was expressed as relative excess risk due to interaction (RERI). A 20-fold increase in adult airway obstruction was found among those with early-onset asthma independently of smoking status (never-smokers: OR 21.0, 95% CI 12.7-35; current smokers: OR 23.7, 95% CI 13.9-40.6). Late-onset asthma was associated with airway obstruction, with a stronger association among current smokers (OR 25.6, 95% CI 15.6-41.9) than among never-smokers (OR 11.2, 95% CI 6.8-18.6) (RERI 12.02, 95% CI 1.96-22.07). Stratifying by atopy, the association between smoking and asthma was most pronounced among nonatopics. Early- and late-onset asthma were associated with 10-20-fold increased risk of adult airway obstruction. Smoking increased the risk of adult airway obstruction in subjects with asthma onset after age 10 years. Investigation of measures potentially preventive of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease development following asthma is urgently needed. "

Two human AlkB homologs were characterized with similar DNA repair activities and seven additional human AlkB homologs were identified based on sequence homology. All these dioxygenases, ALKBH1-8 and FTO, contain a conserved α-ketoglutarate/iron-dependent domain for methyl modifications and de-modifications. Well-designed research over the last 10 years has identified unforeseen substrate heterogeneity for the AlkB homologs, including novel reversible methyl modifications in RNA. The discoveries of RNA demethylation catalyzed by AlkB family enzymes initiated a new realm of gene expression regulation, although the understanding of precise endogenous activities and roles of these RNA demethylases are still undeveloped. It is worth mentioning that the AlkB mechanism and use of α-ketoglutarate have also emerged to be essential for many enzymes in epigenetic reprogramming that modify and de-modify methylated bases in DNA and methylated amino acids in histones."

Volume: 9 Issue: 2 Dec 20 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24976898/,"The Firmicutes represent a major component of the intestinal microflora. The intestinal Firmicutes are a large, diverse group of organisms, many of which are poorly characterized due to their anaerobic growth requirements. Although most Firmicutes are Gram positive, members of the class Negativicutes, including the genus Veillonella, stain Gram negative. Veillonella are among the most abundant organisms of the oral and intestinal microflora of animals and humans, in spite of being strict anaerobes. In this work, the genomes of 24 Negativicutes, including eight Veillonella spp., are compared to 20 other Firmicutes genomes; a further 101 prokaryotic genomes were included, covering 26 phyla. Thus a total of 145 prokaryotic genomes were analyzed by various methods to investigate the apparent conflict of the Veillonella Gram stain and their taxonomic position within the Firmicutes. Comparison of the genome sequences confirms that the Negativicutes are distantly related to Clostridium spp., based on 16S rRNA, complete genomic DNA sequences, and a consensus tree based on conserved proteins. The genus Veillonella is relatively homogeneous: inter-genus pair-wise comparison identifies at least 1,350 shared proteins, although less than half of these are found in any given Clostridium genome. Only 27 proteins are found conserved in all analyzed prokaryote genomes. Veillonella has distinct metabolic properties, and significant similarities to genomes of Proteobacteria are not detected, with the exception of a shared LPS biosynthesis pathway. The clade within the class Negativicutes to which the genus Veillonella belongs exhibits unique properties, most of which are in common with Gram-positives and some with Gram negatives. They are only distantly related to Clostridia, but are even less closely related to Gram-negative species. Though the Negativicutes stain Gram-negative and possess two membranes, the genome and proteome analysis presented here confirm their place within the (mainly) Gram positive phylum of the Firmicutes. Further studies are required to unveil the evolutionary history of the Veillonella and other Negativicutes. "

Volume: 269 Issue: 1499 Jul 22 2002,2002,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12137574/,"Sexual-selection theories generally assume that mating preferences are heritable traits. However, there is substantial evidence that the rearing environment may be important for the development of mating preferences, indicating that they may be learnt, or modified by experience. The relative importance of such sexual imprinting across species remains largely unexplored. Here, we report results of a large-scale cross-fostering experiment in the wild in which nestling birds were raised by parents of a different species. We show that resulting sexual imprinting may have a negative effect on pairing success in one species (the great tit, Parus major), but not in two other species (the blue tit, P. caeruleus and the pied flycatcher, Ficedula hypoleuca). A remarkable variation thus seems to exist, even between species that are congeneric and have similar breeding ecologies. The cross-fostering resulted in heterospecific pairings between the two tit species (female blue tit breeding with male great tit), which has never, to our knowledge, been previously documented. However, the chicks fledging from these nests were all blue tit."

Volume: 222 Issue: 1-2 Oct 15 1998,1998,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9842754/,"Seventy-two samples of groundwater derived from Norwegian Quaternary (largely glaciofluvial or glacial) aquifers were analysed for a wide range of major and minor hydrochemical parameters. The waters exhibit a relatively uncomplex evolution from Na-Cl dominated, immature waters (which reflect marine salts in precipitation) to Ca-HCO3 dominated waters via calcite dissolution. The median pH of these waters is 7.37, in contrast to similar waters from crystalline bedrock aquifers with a median pH of 8.07. The water samples provide little evidence of significant acidification or sulphatisation of groundwaters by 'acid rain'. In fact, a positive correlation emerges between non-marine sulphate and alkalinity/pH, suggesting dominantly lithological sources for non-marine sulphate. No groundwaters from Quaternary deposits exceed maximum recommended concentrations for Rn, F- and Na, while 10% fall outside the required pH range. This again contrasts with bedrock aquifers where 30% of waters are non-compliant with respect to one or more of these parameters."

Volume: 64 Issue: 3 Mar 1990,1990,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2154609/,"We have previously shown that aminoglycosides such as neomycin and the polyamino acids polylysine and polyarginine selectively inhibit the binding of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) to the cellular receptor, whereas HSV-2 infection is unaffected. In the present study we took advantage of this difference between HSV-1 and HSV-2 by using HSV(-1)-HSV(-2) intertypic recombinants to locate a region on the HSV-1 genome encoding proteins affecting the binding of the virion to the cellular receptor. The results were consistent with those obtained by marker rescue experiments. The identified region, which mapped between coordinates 0.580 and 0.687, contains two partial and eight complete genes, including the glycoprotein C (gC) gene and two others with potential transmembrane sequences. Various gC monoclonal antibody-resistant mutants of HSV-1 as well as a mutant completely lacking gC were found to be fully sensitive to neomycin, suggesting that gC is not the site of drug sensitivity and is not essential for adsorption of virus to the cellular receptor. However, the rate of adsorption was reduced in the absence of gC, indicating a facilitating function of the glycoprotein. The universal nature of this HSV-1 receptor binding was revealed by the similarity in drug sensitivity of infectivity in four different cell lines from various tissues and species."

Between August 1995 and June 1997, blood was collected from 66 140 people in the second Norwegian Health Study of Nord-Trøndelag (HUNT2). During a seven-year follow-up, 505 VT cases were identified. 1458 age- and sex-matched controls were selected from the original cohort. Serum total homocysteine (tHcy) and MTHFR genotype were measured in stored samples that were drawn a median of 33 months before the events. The overall odds ratio (OR) was 1.50 [95% confidence interval (CI) 0.97-2.30] for homocysteine levels above versus below the 95th percentile. There was no graded association with VT over quintiles of homocysteine. In men the OR was 2.17 (95% CI 1.20-3.91) for levels above versus below the 95th percentile, but no association was found in women (OR 1.00). Stratification by age, predisposing risk factors or time to event did not change these results. The MTHFR 677TT genotype was not related to risk for VT. In conclusion, elevated homocysteine levels in the general population predicted subsequent first VT in men but not in women."

The VAS scores showed large variability within each category on the verbal rating scale. A common way of analysing pain in migraine studies is to classify patient response as a success or failure based on the score on the four-point verbal rating scale. In this study, the statistical power of analysing response either as ""success or failure"" or by means of the VAS score has been investigated by stochastic simulation.

Volume: 210 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25991156/,"In North Norway no routine home telemonitoring services for chronic heart failure has yet been established and hence no investigations in the field have been published, although large distances and a sparse population are causes for extra public and private expenditure on travelling for patients when they make a visit to the hospital. In this paper we describe the ePoint.telemed platform for home telemonitoring of patients with chronic heart failure (CHF). The core of the platform is a dashboard, which is accessible through a browser window. Integrated with the dashboard are a blood pressure meter, a weight scale and a web-based patient questionnaire. The ePoint.telemed platform is a fully automatic internet based system meant for early warning in a CHF rehabilitation program. Unlike traditional remote medical technologies (RMT) building on dedicated medical equipment, we are applying easy-to-use personal health system (PHS) components geared towards the wellness and sports market. A Randomized Controlled Trial (RCT) has been started using the platform. 50 patients will be involved in the study with the aim of finding out if the home telemonitoring of CHF is clinically effective in Northern Norway and if it is cost-effective.

Volume: 1108 Jun 2007,2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17894008/,"Primary Sjögren's syndrome is a complex autoimmune disorder, considered to represent an ideal disease with which to study the mechanisms underlying autoimmunity because its manifestations are both organ specific and systemic in nature. The characteristic histologic finding in target organs is a progressive focal infiltration of mononuclear lymphoid cells, replacing glandular epithelium (lymphoepithelial lesion). This involvement has been re-emphasized in the 2002 revised EU criteria for Sjögren's syndrome. Moreover, ectopic secondary lymphoid follicles in Sjögren's syndrome contain all elements of relevance for driving an autoimmune response. A number of cytokines and chemokines are involved and particularly B cell activating factor seems to direct the lifespan of infiltrating B cells by enhancing their proliferation and maturation. The recent discovery of clinical benefit after B cell depletion also highlights the pivotal role of B cells in Sjögren's syndrome. A major challenge in Sjögren's syndrome will be to stratify the disease process including genetic and environmental triggers. Identification of novel genetic and molecular markers may lead to the development of better diagnostic and prognostic tools in Sjögren's syndrome including its systemic complications. This minor review will cover the current knowledge on classification, pathogenesis, multiplex findings, potential candidate genes, gene profiling results, and novel therapy approaches. New hypotheses behind the complexity of Sjögren's syndrome are expected to follow."
526,Assessing the spatiotemporal evolution of neuronal activation with single-trial event-related potentials and functional MRI.,16314575,Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America. Volume: 102 Issue: 49 Dec 06 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16314575/,"The brain acts as an integrated information processing system, which methods in cognitive neuroscience have so far depicted in a fragmented fashion. Here, we propose a simple and robust way to integrate functional MRI (fMRI) with single trial event-related potentials (ERP) to provide a more complete spatiotemporal characterization of evoked responses in the human brain. The idea behind the approach is to find brain regions whose fMRI responses can be predicted by paradigm-induced amplitude modulations of simultaneously acquired single trial ERPs. The method was used to study a variant of a two-stimulus auditory target detection (odd-ball) paradigm that manipulated predictability through alternations of stimulus sequences with random or regular target-to-target intervals. In addition to electrophysiologic and hemodynamic evoked responses to auditory targets per se, single-trial modulations were expressed during the latencies of the P2 (170-ms), N2 (200-ms), and P3 (320-ms) components and predicted spatially separated fMRI activation patterns. These spatiotemporal matches, i.e., the prediction of hemodynamic activation by time-variant information from single trial ERPs, permit inferences about regional responses using fMRI with the temporal resolution provided by electrophysiology."

Volume: 399 1995,1995,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8610504/,"Contrast media (CM) affect normal cardiac electrophysiology when injected into the coronary arteries. High-osmolality CM cause more pronounced electrophysiological effects than do low-osmolality CM. Further, both high- and low-osmolality ionic CM have more pronounced effects than the nonionic CM. The CM-induced electrophysiological effects involve regional disturbances of depolarization and repolarization, thereby causing disturbances of impulse conduction as well as dispersion of refractoriness. Recent experimental studies have demonstrated that the addition of sodium or a balanced electrolyte supplement to nonionic CM reduces the risk of ventricular fibrillation (VF), particularly when the CM is injected in a wedged catheter situation. The reduced risk of VF may be due to the small and transient lengthening of repolarization seen in the CM-perfused area of the myocardium. Iodixanol, which is an isotonic nonionic dimer supplemented with NaCl and CaCl(2), is as well tolerated as iohexol during free coronary flow. However, when flow is restricted, such as when CM is injected through a wedged catheter, the risk of VF is less with iodixanol than with iopamidol, iohexol and ioxaglate."

In the present study, focal ischemic lesions were produced in rats by permanent occlusion of the middle cerebral artery (MCA). The animals were killed from 1 to 48 h postlesion. Leakage of plasma proteins across the blood-brain barrier into the infarcted area was visualized with immunostaining 2-3 h after the occlusion. This is earlier than in most previous reports. Entry of plasma proteins into ischemic neurons was seen 3 h after permanent occlusion of the MCA, while reliable changes were not seen until 12-24 h in sections stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H & E). Ischemic neurons stained for plasma proteins irrespective of their morphological appearance. Even cells that appeared normal with H & E staining were positively labeled. The technique may be used to diagnose very early ischemic lesions."

By STR marker analysis the 8p deletion proved to be quite large, at least 6.74 Mb, while the 8q deletion was small, around 2.5 Mb. The haplotype analysis also demonstrated that the r(8) originated from a maternal chromosome 8, and that cells with normal male karyotype resulted from monosomy 8 rescue after loss of the ring 8, i.e. a mitotic duplication of the paternal chromosome 8. The patient has a mild phenotype with no malformations and mild mental retardation, also compared to other ring chromosome 8 patients.

531,Different tolerance to hypothermia and rewarming of isolated rat and guinea pig hearts.,10328914,Cryobiology. Volume: 38 Issue: 3 May 1999,1999,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10328914/,"We examined the effect of hypothermia and rewarming on myocardial function and calcium control in Langendorff-perfused hearts from rat and guinea pig. Both rat and guinea pig hearts demonstrated a rise in myocardial calcium ([Ca]total) in response to hypothermic perfusion (40 min, 10 degrees C), which was accompanied by an increase in left ventricular end diastolic pressure (LVEDP). The elevation in [Ca]total was severalfold higher in guinea pig than in rat hearts, reaching 12.9 +/- 0.8 and 3.1 +/- 0.6 micromol.g dry wt-1, respectively. The rise in LVEDP, however, was comparable in the two species: 62.5 +/- 2.5 (guinea pig) and 52.5 +/- 5.1 mm Hg (rat). Following rewarming, [Ca]total remained elevated in guinea pig, whereas a moderate decline in [Ca]total was observed in the rat (13.6 +/- 1.9 and 2.2 +/- 0.3 micromol.g dry wt-1, respectively). Posthypothermic values of LVEDP were also significantly higher in guinea pig compared to rat hearts (42.5 +/- 6.8 vs 20.5 +/- 5.1 mm Hg, P < 0.027). Furthermore, whereas rat hearts demonstrated a 78 +/- 7% recovery of left ventricular developed pressure, there was only a 15 +/- 7% recovery in guinea pig hearts. Measurements of tissue levels of high energy phosphates and glycogen utilization indicated a higher metabolic requirement in guinea pig than in rat hearts in order to oppose the hypothermia-induced calcium load. Thus, we conclude that isolated guinea pig hearts are more sensitive to a hypothermic insult than rat hearts."

Volume: 8 Issue: 5 May 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22495121/,"Intranasal vaccination can effectively induce both local and systemic immune responses and protect against influenza, but poses a risk of antigen or adjuvant delivery into the central nervous system (CNS). Sublingual vaccine delivery has recently received increased attention as a safer alternative to the intranasal route. Studies comparing the two routes have found that higher immune responses may be induced by intranasal than sublingual administration, possibly as a consequence of the differences in mucosal tissues between the two routes. Here we examine evidence of antigen transport into the CNS following intranasal immunisation and discuss possible reasons for the superiority of the intranasal as compared with the sublingual route in terms of vaccine immunogenicity. We encourage generation of more information on the safety of mucosal adjuvants and propose that the next generation of vaccines and adjuvants may be designed specifically for administration via the different mucosal routes."
533,Diabetic hyperglycemia reduces Ca2+ permeability of extrasynaptic AMPA receptors in AII amacrine cells.,26156384,Journal of neurophysiology. Volume: 114 Issue: 3 Sep 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26156384/,"There is increasing evidence that diabetic retinopathy is a primary neuropathological disorder that precedes the microvascular pathology associated with later stages of the disease. Recently, we found evidence for altered functional properties of synaptic α-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA) receptors in A17, but not AII, amacrine cells in the mammalian retina, and the observed changes were consistent with an upregulation of the GluA2 subunit, a key determinant of functional properties of AMPA receptors, including Ca(2+) permeability and current-voltage (I-V) rectification properties. Here, we have investigated functional changes of extrasynaptic AMPA receptors in AII amacrine cells evoked by diabetes. With patch-clamp recording of nucleated patches from retinal slices, we measured Ca(2+) permeability and I-V rectification in rats with ∼3 wk of streptozotocin-induced diabetes and age-matched, noninjected controls. Under bi-ionic conditions (extracellular Ca(2+) concentration = 30 mM, intracellular Cs(+) concentration = 171 mM), the reversal potential (Erev) of AMPA-evoked currents indicated a significant reduction of Ca(2+) permeability in diabetic animals [Erev = -17.7 mV, relative permeability of Ca(2+) compared with Cs(+) (PCa/PCs) = 1.39] compared with normal animals (Erev = -7.7 mV, PCa/PCs = 2.35). Insulin treatment prevented the reduction of Ca(2+) permeability. I-V rectification was examined by calculating a rectification index (RI) as the ratio of the AMPA-evoked conductance at +40 and -60 mV. The degree of inward rectification in patches from diabetic animals (RI = 0.48) was significantly reduced compared with that in normal animals (RI = 0.30). These results suggest that diabetes evokes a change in the functional properties of extrasynaptic AMPA receptors of AII amacrine cells. These changes could be representative for extrasynaptic AMPA receptors elsewhere in AII amacrine cells and suggest that synaptic and extrasynaptic AMPA receptors are differentially regulated. "

The causal effect of education on IQ at later ages is often difficult to uncover because analyses based on observational data are plagued by problems of reverse causation and self-selection into further education. We exploit a reform that increased compulsory schooling from 7 to 9 y in Norway in the 1960s to estimate the effect of education on IQ. We find that this schooling reform, which primarily affected education in the middle teenage years, had a substantial effect on IQ scores measured at the age of 19 y."

Volume: 78 Issue: 5 Sep 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29869532/,"Alloimmunization against the RhD antigen is the most common cause of hemolytic disease of the fetus and newborn. Antenatal anti-D prophylaxis in addition to postnatal anti-D prophylaxis reduces the number of RhD-immunizations compared to only postnatal administration. Cell-free fetal DNA released from the apoptotic trophoblastic placental cells into the maternal circulation can be used to determine the fetal RHD type in a blood sample from an RhD negative mother. Based on this typing, antenatal anti-D prophylaxis can be recommended only to RhD negative women carrying an RhD positive fetus, since only these women are at risk of developing anti-D. The objective was to establish and validate a method for non-invasive fetal RHD typing. The fetal RHD genotype was studied in 373 samples from RhD negative pregnant women (median gestational week 24). DNA extracted from plasma was analyzed for the presence/absence of RHD exon 7 and 10 in a real-time PCR. The RHD genotype of the fetus was compared with the serological RhD type of the newborn. In 234 samples, the fetal RHD test was positive and in 127 samples negative. There was one false positive and no false negative results. In 12 samples, the fetal RHD type could not be determined, in all of them due to a maternal RHD gene. This method gives a reliable detection of fetal RHD positivity in plasma from RhD negative pregnant women. Antenatal anti-D prophylaxis based on the predicted fetal RhD type will avoid unnecessary treatment of pregnant women carrying an RhD negative fetus."

The aim of this study was to analyze the fracture features of glass-ceramic and zirconia-based restorations fractured during clinical use. Twenty-seven crowns and onlays were supplied by dentists and dental technicians with information about type of cement and time in function, if available. Fourteen lithium disilicate glass-ceramic restorations and 13 zirconia-based restorations were retrieved and analyzed. Fractographic features were examined using optical microscopy to determine crack initiation and crack propagation of the restorations. The material comprised fractured restorations from one canine, 10 incisors, four premolars, and 11 molars. One crown was not categorized because of difficulty in orientation of the fragments. The results revealed that all core and veneer fractures initiated in the cervical margin and usually from the approximal area close to the most coronally placed curvature of the margin. Three cases of occlusal chipping were found. The margin of dental all-ceramic single-tooth restorations was the area of fracture origin. The fracture features were similar for zirconia, glass-ceramic, and alumina single-tooth restorations. Design features seem to be of great importance for fracture initiation."

Volume: 135 Issue: 37 Sep 18 2013,2013,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24016308/,"There is a surging interest in 3D graphitic nanostructures which possess outstanding properties enabling them to be prime candidates for a new generation of nanodevices and energy-absorbing materials. Here we study the stretching instability and reversibility of tightly wound helical carbon nanotubes (HCNTs) by atomistic simulations. The intercoil van der Waals (vdW) interaction-induced flattening of HCNT walls prior to loading is constrained by the defects coordinated for the curvature formation of helices. The HCNTs exhibit extensive stretchability in the range from 400% to 1000% as a result of two distinct deformation mechanisms depending on the HCNT size. For small HCNTs tremendous deformation is achieved by domino-type partial fracture events, whereas for large HCNTs this is accomplished by stepwise buckling of coils. The formation and fracture of edge-closed graphene ribbons occur at lower temperatures, while at elevated temperatures the highly distributed fracture realizes a phenomenal stretchability. The results of cyclic stretching-reversing simulations of large HCNTs display pronounced hysteresis loops, which produce large energy dissipation via full recovery of buckling and vdW bondings. This study provides physical insights into the origins of high ductility and superior reversibility of hybrid CNT structures. "

The data indicate that at least two effects of glucagon (cAMP) on hepatocyte proliferation exist; in addition to a growth-promoting modulation early in the prereplicative period, there is also an inhibitory effect of glucagon (as well as other cAMP-elevating agents) that is exerted at a point shortly before the G1-to-S transition. Because both effects occur dose-dependently in the normal range of glucagon concentrations in portal blood, it is conceivable that glucagon/cAMP is involved both when liver growth is initiated and terminated."

The adsorption was stable for at least 3 h at 37 degrees C. In the presence of purified factor I, the indicator cells, however, detached from the sections after 30 min at 37 degrees C. Factor H was not required. The release was not due to loss of CR1 activity in the tissue. The detached indicator cells were negative in the immune adherence test and were agglutinated by antibody to C3d, but not by antibody to C3c. Western blot of the detached indicator cells revealed the presence of C3d and C3c was found in the chamber fluid. Accordingly, detachment of the indicator cells was due to degradation of C3b to C3d with the release of C3c into the chamber fluid. Protease inhibitors did not prevent the detachment of the indicator cells. EAC3b incubated with sections of renal glomeruli preincubated with anti-CR1 antibody were not degraded. The results therefore indicate that CR1 in situ in renal glomeruli can provide the necessary cofactor activity for factor I-mediated degradation of C3b to C3d and C3c."

Volume: 11 Issue: 1 Jan 2007",2007,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16480907/,"In a one-year longitudinal study, emotional/behavioural correlates and predictors of four common pain complaints (headaches, stomach, back and limb pain), were examined in a representative school sample of 2360 adolescents aged 12- to 15-years. At first assessment, 18.3% reported being bothered by a frequent pain (at least once a week) and 40% of the pain sufferers had two or more pain locations, more commonly reported by girls. Subjects having any of the four frequent pains reported having fewer friends and were more often absent from school. Frequency and number of reported pains among adolescents were positively related to levels of internalising and externalising problems. These latter problems were consistently and significantly higher among adolescents with frequent back and limb pains, however, when coexistence of another frequent pain was controlled, differences were small. Number of pains at the one-year follow-up was significantly predicted by frequent back pain and headache, depressive symptoms scores, somatic complaints (other than pain), number of friends and reduced leisure time activities during the follow-up period. Frequent back pain and depressive symptoms also predicted multiple frequent pains (vs single frequent pain) at the follow-up as did recent parental divorce. It is concluded that various emotional and behavioural problems, and which are commonly regarded as being specifically related to pain type or location among adolescents, depend rather on frequency and coexistence of multiple frequent pains. Assessment of adolescents with frequent and multiple pains should, therefore, include broad screening of internalising as well as externalising problems as well as various aspects of impairment."

A power-law has been shown to provide the best mathematical description of this relationship. However, it remains unclear what evolutionary forces drive this observation. We use models of gene duplication, pseudogenisation and accumulation of replacement substitutions, which have been validated and parameterised using genomic data, to build a model of homologous gene evolution. We use this model to simulate the evolution of the distribution of gene family size and show that the power-law distribution is driven by the pseudogenisation rate's heterogeneity across gene families and its correlation within families. Moreover, we show that gene duplication and pseudogenisation are necessary and sufficient for the emergence of the power-law."

MMP9 rs17576 and OPRM1 rs1799971 remained significant (B = 0.4, 95% CI 0.05-0.8, P = 0.026 and B = -0.8, 95% CI -1.3 to -0.2, P = 0.007) in the multivariable model. Thus, the data demonstrated that the rare allele of MMP9 rs17576 was associated with poor pain recovery, whereas the rare allele of OPRM1 rs1799971 was associated with better pain recovery at 5-year follow-up in the LBP and LRP patients. In particular, the present study suggested that the OPRM1 rs179971 A>G in men was associated with better long-term pain recovery. In men, the OPRM1 rs1799971 explained 4.7% of the variance of pain intensity. We conclude that the MMP9 rs17576 and OPRM1 rs1799971 genotypes may affect 5-year recovery in patients with LBP and LRP."
553,Are we entering a new era for qualitative research? Using qualitative evidence to support guidance and guideline development by the World Health Organization.,30244675,International journal for equity in health. Volume: 17 Issue: 1 09 24 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30244675/,"Qualitative approaches are one of several methodologies utilised within the social sciences. New developments within qualitative methods are widening the opportunities for using qualitative evidence to inform health policy and systems decisions. In this commentary, we discuss how, in our work with the World Health Organization (WHO), we have explored ways of broadening the types of evidence used to develop evidence-informed guidance for health systems.Health systems decisions are commonly informed by evidence on the effectiveness of health system interventions. However, decision makers and other stakeholders also typically have additional questions, including how different stakeholders value different outcomes, the acceptability and feasibility of different interventions and the impacts of these interventions on equity and human rights. Evidence from qualitative research can help address these questions, and a number of WHO guidelines are now using qualitative evidence in this way. This growing use of qualitative evidence to inform decision making has been facilitated by recent methodological developments, including robust methods for qualitative evidence syntheses and approaches for assessing how much confidence to place in findings from such syntheses. For research evidence to contribute optimally to improving and sustaining the performance of health systems, it needs to be transferred easily between different elements of what has been termed the 'evidence ecosystem'. This ecosystem includes primary and secondary evidence producers, guidance developers and those implementing and evaluating interventions to strengthen health systems. We argue that most of the elements of an ecosystem for qualitative evidence are now in place - an important milestone that suggests that we are entering a new era for qualitative research. However, a number of challenges and constraints remain. These include how to build stronger links between the communities involved in the different parts of the qualitative evidence ecosystem and the need to strengthen capacity, particularly in low and middle income countries, to produce and utilise qualitative evidence and decision products informed by such evidence. We invite others who want to support the wider use of qualitative evidence in decision processes to look for opportunities in their settings to put this into practice."

Patients scheduled for trephine biopsy were recruited to the study. Local anesthesia was applied in all patients. Pain intensity was recorded twice daily by the patients using the numeric rating scale (NRS). Bleeding was graded into four grades. Median age of 184 patients was 63 yr. Maximum NRS level was measured at time of biopsy (T0); 167 (91%) patients experienced pain at T0. Median (Q1:Q3) NRS was 3 (1; 5). Median duration of pain was 36 h. Fourteen patients reported pain for more than 7 d. Significant inverse correlation was found between NRS at T0 and age. Pain duration at rest correlated with NRS at T0 and age, while pain duration in activity correlated with NRS at T0, age, and with body mass index (BMI). Mild and moderate bleeding at T0 occurred in 97 (54%) and 18 (10%) patients, respectively; no severe bleeding or infectious complications were registered. Secondary bleeding occurred in two patients; both required hospitalization. In conclusion, the study shows that despite the application of local anesthetic, more than 50% of the patients experienced pain of ≥ 3 points. Procedure-related bleeding is mild to moderate and managed by local pressure only."

Volume: 187 Issue: 6 Sep 15 2011",2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21841131/,"To understand the biology of Ab-secreting cells in the human small intestine, we examined Ab production of intestinal biopsies kept in culture. We found sustained IgA and IgM secretion as well as viable IgA- or IgM-secreting cells after >4 wk of culture. The Ab-secreting cells were nonproliferating and expressing CD27 and CD138, thus having a typical plasma cell phenotype. Culturing of biopsies without tissue disruption gave the highest Ab production and plasma cell survival suggesting that the environment regulates plasma cell longevity. Cytokine profiling of the biopsy cultures demonstrated a sustained presence of IL-6 and APRIL. Blocking of the activity of endogenous APRIL and IL-6 with BCMA-Fc and anti-human IL-6 Ab demonstrated that both these factors were essential for plasma cell survival and Ab secretion in the biopsy cultures. This study demonstrates that the human small intestine harbors a population of nonproliferating plasma cells that are instructed by the microenvironment for prolonged survival and Ab secretion."

Volume: 118 Issue: 34 Aug 28 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25026002/,"Removal of toxic gases like SO2 by cosequestration with CO2 in deep saline aquifers is a very attractive suggestion from environmental, human health and economic point of view. Examination of feasibility of this technique and forecasting the underlying fluid-rock interactions requires precise knowledge about the phase equilibria of the ternary mixture of SO2-CO2-H2O at conditions relevant to carbon capture and storage (CCS). In this study, a molecular-based statistical association fluid theory (SAFT1) model is applied to estimate the phase equilibria and aqueous phase density of mixtures. The molecules are modeled as associating segments while self-association is not allowed. The model is tested for different SO2 concentrations and for temperatures and pressures varying between 30-100 °C and ∼6-30 MPa, respectively. Comparison of the results of this model against the available experimental data of binary systems demonstrates the capability of this equation of state, although, in contrast to the previous works, no temperature dependent binary interaction coefficient is applied. The results show that the total solubility of SO2 + CO2 in water varies exponentially with respect to SO2 concentrations, i.e., at low concentrations of SO2, total changes in solubility of the CO2 in water is negligible.

Volume: 111 Issue: 4 Aug 1997,1997,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28308113/,"The lichens Lasallia pustulata and Umbilicaria spodochroa grow in dense monospecific or mixed populations on the coastal cliffs of southern Scandinavia. Attached to the substrate by only a thin central holdfast, their shield-shaped thalli compete for light and space for growth by overlapping each other. Matched pair experiments in the laboratory and field observations of interacting pairs show that different behavioural responses to precipitation tend to result in the margins of U. spodochroa overlapping those of L. pustulata within a few minutes. The behaviour is apparently caused by different capacities for water absorption in the upper and lower cortices of the species. An initial period of repeated encounter caused by thallus expansion and contraction during precipitation will be followed by a period in which U. spodochroa grows to overlap L. pustulata more and more. When the overlapping lichens are wet, flexible and photosynthetically active, the thallus above rests directly on the upper surface of the one below. Very little light is transmitted through thalli of U. spodochroa, and the shaded parts of L. pustulata are retarded in their growth and die off."

Volume: 135 Issue: 12 Sep 28 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21974544/,"In this paper, we consider a simple reaction-diffusion system, namely, a binary fluid mixture with an association-dissociation reaction between two species. We study fluctuations at hydrodynamic spatiotemporal scales when this mixture is driven out of equilibrium by the presence of a temperature gradient, while still being far away from any chemical instability. This study extends the analysis in our first paper on the subject [J. M. Ortiz de Zárate, J. V. Sengers, D. Bedeaux, and S. Kjelstrup, J. Chem. Phys. 127, 034501 (2007)], where we considered fluctuations in a non-isothermal reaction-diffusion system but still close to equilibrium. The present extension is based on mesoscopic non-equilibrium thermodynamics that we recently developed [D. Bedeaux, I. Pagonabarraga, J. M. Ortiz de Zárate, J. V. Sengers, and S. Kjelstrup, Phys. Chem. Chem. Phys. 12, 12780 (2010)] to derive the law of mass action and fluctuation-dissipation theorems for the random contributions to the dissipative fluxes in the nonlinear macroscopic description. Just as for non-equilibrium fluctuations close to equilibrium, we again find an enhancement of the intensity of the concentration fluctuations in the presence of a temperature gradient. The non-equilibrium concentration fluctuations are in both cases spatially long ranged, with an intensity depending on the wave number q. The intensity exhibits a crossover from a ∝q(-4) to a ∝q(-2) behavior depending on whether the corresponding wavelength is smaller or larger than the penetration depth of the reacting mixture. This opens a possibility to distinguish between diffusion- or activation-controlled regimes of the reaction experimentally. The important conclusion overall is that non-equilibrium fluctuations in non-isothermal reaction-diffusion systems are always long ranged."

Seventeen caries-active elderly Chinese with poor oral hygiene and with both sound and carious root surfaces were examined. Plaque pH was measured before and up to one hour after a controlled sucrose mouthrinse. Plaque samples for microbiologic analyses were collected from 2 sound and 2 or 3 carious pH-measurement sites in each subject. The prevalence of the following micro-organisms was assessed as % of total viable counts on Brucella agar: Prevotella intermedia, Prevotella melaninogenica, Fusobacterium nucleatum, Campylobacter rectus, Capnocytophaga spp., Actinomyces viscosus, Actinomyces naeslundi, Streptococcus spp., S. sanguis, S. mitis, S. mutans, S. sobrinus, Lactobacillus spp., and Candida spp. There was no difference in plaque pH response on sound and carious root surfaces. The plaque pH response was more pronounced in the maxilla than in the mandible for both sound and carious sites. There was no difference in microbial composition of dental plaque on sound and carious root surfaces. The pH response to sucrose was the same regardless of the presence or absence of mutans streptococci. Our results thus do not readily support the traditional concept of caries formation."

The dental materials were found to be composites consisting of remaining, undissolved particles from the Ag-based alloy powders in a matrix of reaction products with the Ga alloy. SEM studies have been carried out to give an overview of the composites. The distribution of the elements was found by the X-ray mapping technique. The phases in the matrix and the remaining alloy particles have been identified by electron diffraction, high-resolution electron microscopy and energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy. The following phases were identified in the LU alloy: orthorhombic Ag3Sn, cubic Ag9In4, tetragonal beta-Sn and hexagonal Ag2Ga. In addition to these well-known phases Ga-rich regions were observed consisting of an intergrowth of tetragonal CuGa2 and one of the cubic gamma-Cu9Ga4 phases. In addition to these phases cubic Ga7Pd3 was found in the GF alloy. The anomalous setting expansion of the GF alloy may be explained by the presence of Ga7Pd3."

Considering the different treatment modalities involved, quality of life has been thought of as an additional end point criterion for use in clinical trials. A Nordic protocol to measure the quality of life of head and neck cancer patients before, during, and after treatment was established. Before the study, a pilot study was done with this protocol. The main purpose of this pilot study was to find out whether this cancer population would answer quality-pf-life questionnaires repeatedly (six times) over a 1-year period and whether the chosen questionnaires-a core questionnaire (European Organisation for Research and Treatment of Cancer Core Quality of Life Questionnaire (EORTC QLQ-C30)), a tumor-specific questionnaire, and a psychological distress measure (Hospital Anxiety and Depression scale (HAD))-were sensitive for changes to functions and symptoms during the study year. The results presented in this article all refer to the pilot study. Forty-eight consecutive patients agreed to participate in the study. The most common tumor locations were the oral cavity (17) and the larynx (12). Almost all patients received combined treatment: 45 of 48 radiation therapy, 18 of 48 chemotherapy, and 17 of 48 surgery. After the primary treatment, 40 patients had complete tumor remission. Four of the 48 patients did not answer any questionnaires and were therefore excluded from the study. Of the remaining 44 patients, 3 died during the study year, and another 6 withdrew for various reasons. Thirty-five (85%) of the 41 patients alive at the 1-year follow-up answered all six questionnaires and thus completed the study. Mailed questionnaires were used throughout the study. All questionnaires were well accepted and found to be sensitive to changes during the study year. The greatest variability was found for symptoms and functions related specifically to head and neck cancer. The symptoms were swallowing difficulties, hoarse voice, sore mouth, dry mouth, and problems with taste. They all showed the same pattern, with an increase of symptoms during and just after finishing the treatment. The HAD scale revealed a high level of psychological distress, with 21% probable cases of psychiatric morbidity at diagnosis. In conclusion, it was shown that the study design and questionnaires were feasible for the forthcoming prospective quality-of-life assessment of Swedish and Norwegian head and neck cancer patients."

Ten pairs of premolars to be extracted for orthodontic treatment were used in the first part of this study. Brackets were bonded on all teeth with an orthodontic adhesive, and 10 randomly selected premolars served as controls, whereas a similar number were treated with 1% TiF4 around brackets for 60 seconds. After 4 weeks with no topical fluoride supplementation, all teeth were extracted and stored for analysis. Results indicated the 1% TIF4 solution reduced lesion depths and total mineral loss, at the bracket periphery, significantly during the 4-week period. The presence of a surface coating was demonstrated by SEM micrographs. It was concluded that TiF4 may provide a high level performance as a prophylactic agent for orthodontic purposes."

Genetic predisposition, hormonal and environmental factors are all thought to contribute to disease etiology and pathogenesis. A better understanding of the disease pathogenesis is required in order to establish new targeted therapies. We analysed MAPK/ERK and JAK/STAT signalling networks in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) upon stimulation with interferon alpha 2b (IFN-α2b) by flow cytometry to define potentially dysfunctional intracellular signalling pathways involved in disease pathogenesis. Cells derived from pSS patients displayed small but significant increases in basal phosphorylation levels of numerous signalling proteins compared to cells from healthy donors. The phosphorylation profiles following stimulation with IFNα2b differed significantly between pSS patients and healthy donors, especially regarding STAT1 Y701. PCA further grouped patients according to clinical characteristics. Type I IFN induced gene expression was found to negatively correlate with the IFN-α2b induced phosphorylation of STAT3 S727 in T cells and positively with pSTAT1 Y701 in B cells. Increases in pSTAT1 Y701 were associated with the presence of autoantibodies. Our results indicate involvement of both STAT3 S727 and STAT1 Y701 pathways in pSS patients. Therapies targeting these pathways might therefore be beneficial for certain subgroups of patients."

Volume: 34 Issue: 20 May 14 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24828634/,"The medial entorhinal cortex (MEC) is important for spatial navigation and memory. Stellate cells (SCs) of MEC layer II provide major input to the hippocampus, and are thought to be the neuronal correlate of the grid cells. Their electrophysiological properties have been used to explain grid field formation. However, little is known about the functional roles of potassium channels in SCs. M-current is a slowly activating potassium current, active at subthreshold potentials. Although some studies have suggested that Kv7/M-channels may affect subthreshold resonance in SCs, others have found no Kv7/M-current in these cells, so the expression and roles of Kv7/M-channels in SCs are still debated. Using whole-cell voltage-clamp, we have identified a typical M-current with pharmacological properties characteristic of Kv7/M-channels in rat MEC SCs. Current-clamp experiments showed that the specific Kv7/M-channel blocker XE991 increased SCs excitability, and reduced spike frequency adaptation. Our results demonstrate that Kv7/M-channels are expressed in SCs and contribute substantially to regulation of excitability in these cells. "

Two experimental rat models were used to study if diffusion from these reservoirs could contribute to the phenomenon of postmortem drug redistribution. Overnight fasted rats were sacrificed by CO2 and 75 mg of amitriptyline (AMI) was administered by a gastric tube. In the first series (n = 19), the tubes were removed after AMI administration. In the second series (n = 17), the trachea was ligated and cut prior to drug administration to prevent airways contamination. The rats were left at room temperature on their back for a period of 5, 10, 24, 48, 96 up to 192 h and samples of heart blood, blood from the inferior vena cava, tissue samples from heart, lungs, different liver lobes, kidney and psoas muscle were taken. In both series of rats we observed that as early as 5 h postmortem increasing concentrations of amitriptyline were found in the liver lobes lying closest to the stomach. In rats where the trachea was not ligated, drug contamination of the lungs also resulted in an increase in drug concentration within 5 h in heart blood and heart muscle. In rats where the trachea had been ligated, amitriptyline was found in the lungs after 96 h postmortem. The main metabolite nortriptyline was also detected.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS)"

Jan 21 2019,2019,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/30665327/,"Hypoxia occurs frequently in human cancers and promotes stabilization and activation of hypoxia inducible factor (HIF). HIF-1α is specific for the hypoxia response, and its degradation mediated by three enzymes EGLN1, EGLN2 and EGLN3. Although EGLNs expression has been found to be related to prognosis of many cancers, few studies examined DNA methylation in EGLNs and its relationship to prognosis of early-stage non-small cell lung cancer (NSCLC). We analyzed EGLNs DNA methylation data from tumor tissue samples of 1,230 early-stage NSCLC patients, as well as gene expression data from The Cancer Genome Atlas. The sliding windows sequential forward feature selection method and weighted random forest were used to screen out the candidate CpG probes in lung adenocarcinomas (LUAD) and lung squamous cell carcinomas patients, respectively, in both discovery and validation phases. Then Cox regression was performed to evaluate the association between DNA methylation and overall survival. Among the 34 CpG probes in EGLNs, DNA methylation at cg25923056EGLN2 was identified to be significantly associated with LUAD survival (HR = 1.02, 95% CI: 1.01-1.03, P = 9.90 × 10-5), and correlated with EGLN2 expression (r = - 0.36, P = 1.52 × 10-11). Meanwhile, EGLN2 expression was negatively correlated with HIF1A expression in tumor tissues (r = - 0.30, P = 4.78 × 10-8) and significantly (P = 0.037) interacted with HIF1A expression on overall survival. Therefore, DNA methylation of EGLN2- HIF1A is a potential marker for LUAD prognosis and these genes are potential treatment targets for further development of HIF-1α inhibitors in lung cancer therapy."

Volume: 45 Issue: 10 Oct 2002,2002,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12378378/,We have previously reported that advanced glycation end products are eliminated from the circulation mainly by scavenger receptor-mediated uptake in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells. Our experiments showed that the degradation of AGE-modified protein after endocytosis in hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells occurs slowly compared with that of other scavenger receptor ligands. The aim of this study was to investigate further the mechanism whereby AGE-modified protein affects the important scavenger function of hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells.

Previous studies have focused on quantifying changes in channels, pumps and exchangers without quantitatively linking these changes with emergent cellular scale functionality. Two biophysical cardiac cell models were created, parameterized and validated and are able to simulate electrophysiology and calcium dynamics in myocytes from control sham operated rats and aortic-banded rats exhibiting diastolic dysfunction. The contribution of each ionic pathway to the calcium kinetics was calculated, identifying the L-type Ca2+ channel and sarco/endoplasmic reticulum Ca2+ ATPase as the principal regulators of systolic and diastolic Ca2+ , respectively. Results show that the ability to dynamically change systolic Ca2+ , through changes in expression of key Ca2+ modelling protein densities, is drastically reduced following the aortic banding procedure; however the cells are able to compensate Ca2+ homeostasis in an efficient way to minimize systolic dysfunction."

Volume: 209 Issue: 2-3 Jan 19 1998,1998,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9514038/,"A comparative study is presented of granitic groundwaters from the Hvaler Islands, south-eastern Norway (11 samples) and the Scilly Islands, south-western England (10 samples). The islands display similar bulk lithologies (peraluminous S-type, U/Th-enriched granites) and land use, but differing glaciation and hence weathering histories. The groundwater of both groups bears a strong marine signature, although the Hvaler Islands display less marine influence and a greater degree of water-rock interaction. The most interesting hydrochemical dissimilarities concern the health related trace elements Rn, U and F. These display median (and maximum) values of 2510 Bq/l (8520 Bq/l), 15 micrograms/l (170 micrograms/l) and 3.3 mg/l (4.4 mg/l), respectively, for Hvaler, compared with 140 Bq/l (200 Bq/l), 1.5 micrograms/l (4 micrograms/l) and 0.1 mg/l (0.27 mg/l) for Scilly. Commonly employed drinking water limits for these parameters are 500 Bq/l (Norwegian action level), 20 micrograms/l (Canadian limit) and 1.5 mg/l. The differences in groundwater contents of these elements between Hvaler and Scilly may be ascribed to: (i) differing trace element compositions of the granites and fracture mineralisations; (ii) radically differing recent weathering histories; and (iii) hydrodynamic factors."

Volume: 536 Dec 01 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26204049/,"Analysis of soil C and O horizon samples in a recent regional geochemical survey of Nord-Trøndelag, central Norway (752 sample sites covering 25,000 km2), identified a strong enrichment of several potentially toxic elements (PTEs) in the O horizon. Of 53 elements analysed in both materials, Cd concentrations are, on average, 17 times higher in the O horizon than in the C horizon and other PTEs such as Ag (11-fold), Hg (10-fold), Sb (8-fold), Pb (4-fold) and Sn (2-fold) are all strongly enriched relative to the C horizon. Geochemical maps of the survey area do not reflect an impact from local or distant anthropogenic contamination sources in the data for O horizon soil samples. The higher concentrations of PTEs in the O horizon are the result of the interaction of the underlying geology, the vegetation zone and type, and climatic effects. Based on the general accordance with existing data from earlier surveys in other parts of northern Europe, the presence of a location-independent, superordinate natural trend towards enrichment of these elements in the O horizon relative to the C horizon soil is indicated. The results imply that the O and C horizons of soils are different geochemical entities and that their respective compositions are controlled by different processes. Local mineral soil analyses (or published data for the chemical composition of the average continental crust) cannot be used to provide a geochemical background for surface soil. At the regional scale used here surface soil chemistry is still dominated by natural sources and processes."

Volume: 83 Issue: 3 Mar 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/10884709/,"Essential fatty acids (EFA) are important for the normal development and functioning of the brain, retina and immune competent cells. Severely neurologically handicapped children often have feeding difficulties, and the composition of the diet may be critical with respect to an optimal nutrient content. The aim of the present investigation was to evaluate if the dietary intakes and serum phospholipid concentrations of EFA were adequate in a group of severely neurologically impaired children in an institution. To achieve this, a prospective study was done. The investigation showed low dietary intakes of both n-6 fatty acids (FA) and n-3 FA. The serum concentrations of total n-6 FA, linoleic acid and 22:6n-3 (docosahexaenoic acid) as proportions of the total serum phospholipid FA concentration were initially low. The serum concentrations of 20:3n-9 and 22:5n-6 cholesterol, triacylglycerol, total saturated FA, total monounsaturated FA and apolipoproteins A-I and B were high compared with levels in a reference group of healthy children. Following supplementation with fish oil and soyabean oil, the serum lipid profile approached normal. We conclude that the study children had suboptimal intakes of EFA and that elevated serum concentrations of 20:3n-9 and 22:5n6 were useful serological markers of suboptimal EFA status. Recommended dietary allowances for EFA given as a percentage of energy underestimate EFA requirements in children with a low energy intake. Severely disabled children with feeding difficulties should probably be monitored with serum phospholipid FA measurements or calculation of dietary absolute intakes of EFA."

Volume: 11 Issue: 5 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27196124/,"Foods naturally high in dietary fiber are generally considered to protect against development of colorectal cancer (CRC). However, the intrinsic effect of dietary fiber on intestinal carcinogenesis is unclear. We used azoxymethane (AOM) treated A/J Min/+ mice, which developed a significantly higher tumor load in the colon than in the small intestine, to compare the effects of dietary inulin (IN), cellulose (CE) or brewers spent grain (BSG) on intestinal tumorigenesis and cecal microbiota. Each fiber was tested at two dose levels, 5% and 15% (w/w) content of the AIN-93M diet. The microbiota was investigated by next-generation sequencing of the 16S rRNA gene (V4). We found that mice fed IN had approximately 50% lower colonic tumor load than mice fed CE or BSG (p<0.001). Surprisingly, all three types of fiber caused a dose dependent increase of colonic tumor load (p<0.001). The small intestinal tumor load was not affected by the dietary fiber interventions. Mice fed IN had a lower bacterial diversity than mice fed CE or BSG. The Bacteroidetes/Firmicutes ratio was significantly (p = 0.003) different between the three fiber diets with a higher mean value in IN fed mice compared with BSG and CE. We also found a relation between microbiota and the colonic tumor load, where many of the operational taxonomic units (OTUs) related to low tumor load were significantly enriched in mice fed IN. Among the OTUs related to low tumor load were bacteria affiliated with the Bacteroides genus. These results suggest that type of dietary fiber may play a role in the development of CRC, and that the suppressive effect of IN on colonic tumorigenesis is associated with profound changes in the cecal microbiota profile."

Of the 72 bears tested, 42 (58%) were ELISA positive and 53 (73%) were RBPT positive. However, the coherence between the tests was only fair (K=0.37, SE=0.11), suggesting that either the serologic results were not compatible with Brucella spp. infection or that there was a technical problem with the tests. To address a potential technical problem, we performed a 30-min chloroform/centrifugation cleanup. Following cleanup, the ELISA identified 43 positives (59%) and the RBPT identified 47 (65%), and the coherence between the tests was much improved (K=0.80, SE=0.07). We recommend cleaning wildlife sera with a high lipid content before performing RBPT and performing RBPT and ELISA in parallel to assess coherence. Our results suggest that Alaskan brown bears have been exposed to Brucella spp."

Magnetic beads have proven valuable in cell separations, for example, removal of tumor cells from bone marrow and isolation of lymphoid cells from peripheral blood, and for the isolation, identification and genetic analysis of specific nucleic acid sequences (DNA or RNA) and for isolation of DNA binding proteins. In addition, some of these techniques have also proven to be useful in the detection of specific nucleic acids from viruses or bacteria."

Volume: 13 Issue: 4 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29652884/,"Neochloris oleoabundans is an oleaginous microalgal species that can be cultivated in fresh water as well as salt water. Using salt water gives the opportunity to reduce production costs and the fresh water footprint for large scale cultivation. Production of triacylglycerols (TAG) usually includes a biomass growth phase in nitrogen-replete conditions followed by a TAG accumulation phase under nitrogen-deplete conditions. This is the first report that provides insight in the saline resistance mechanism of a fresh water oleaginous microalgae. To better understand the osmoregulatory mechanism of N. oleoabundans during growth and TAG accumulating conditions, the transcriptome was sequenced under four different conditions: fresh water nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions, and salt water (525 mM dissolved salts, 448mM extra NaCl) nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions. In this study, several pathways are identified to be responsible for salt water adaptation of N. oleoabundans under both nitrogen-replete and -deplete conditions. Proline and the ascorbate-glutathione cycle seem to be of importance for successful osmoregulation in N. oleoabundans. Genes involved in Proline biosynthesis were found to be upregulated in salt water. This was supported by Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, which indicated an increase in proline content in the salt water nitrogen-replete condition. Additionally, the lipid accumulation pathway was studied to gain insight in the gene regulation in the first 24 hours after nitrogen was depleted. Oil accumulation is increased under nitrogen-deplete conditions in a comparable way in both fresh and salt water. The mechanism behind the biosynthesis of compatible osmolytes can be used to improve N. oleoabundans and other industrially relevant microalgal strains to create a more robust and sustainable production platform for microalgae derived products in the future."

Hcy-thiolactone causes protein damage, cellular toxicity, and proatherogenic changes in gene expression in human cells and tissues. A polymorphic cardio-protective enzyme, paraoxonase 1 (PON1), hydrolyzes Hcy-thiolactone in vitro. However, whether Hcy-thiolactone hydrolysis is a physiologic function of the PON1 protein and whether polymorphisms in the PON1 gene affect Hcy-thiolactone levels in humans was unknown. Here we show that the PON1-192 genotype, which affects the enzymatic activity of the PON1 protein, also affected urinary Hcy-thiolactone levels, normalized to creatinine. Carriers of the PON1-192R allele had significantly lower Hcy-thiolactone/creatinine levels than individuals carrying the PON1-192Q allele. Individuals with low serum PON1 paraoxonase activity had significantly higher Hcy-thiolactone/creatinine levels compared with individuals with high paraoxonase activity. In contrast, Hcy-thiolactone/creatinine levels were unaffected by serum PON1 arylesterase activity or by PON1 protein levels. Taken together, these findings suggest that PON1 hydrolyzes Hcy-thiolactone in humans and that the interindividual variations in PON1 genotype/activity can modulate the pathology of hyperhomocysteinemia.-Perła-Kaján, J., Borowczyk, K., Głowacki, R., Nygård, O., Jakubowski, H.

These represent the complete cohort of patients being considered for transplantation between 1990 and 1997. Of the 25 children and their families, 24 sets underwent a comprehensive psychosocial assessment, including interviews with both parents and their children. The parents completed the Child Behavior Checklist and the General Health Questionnaire. We had accepted 15 children for transplantation and placed them on the waiting list. The others were rejected for medical reasons, and 3 died whilst waiting for an organ. One was reconsidered for conventional surgery and removed from the list. Transplantation was performed in 11 children, whilst one of the patients we had rejected underwent transplantation abroad, and was included in the study. This left 12 patients in the final sample, with a mean age of 8 years, and with a range from 11 months to 13.9 years. We reassessed their psychosocial and physical functioning two years after transplantation. Of those undergoing transplantation of the heart and lungs, two were severely affected by progressive obliterative bronchiolitis. The others were in good general physical condition. At the assessment prior to transplantation, three already fulfilled the criterions for diagnosis of an overanxious disorder. Two others had symptoms of anxiety and depression, but without fulfilling the accepted criterions. At follow- up, two patients retained this psychiatric diagnosis. Increased levels of stress were uncovered in the parents prior to surgery, but these had normalised at follow-up. The study shows that, in general, physical and psychological conditions improve in children undergoing transplantation, but they and their parents live in a stressful environment, and are in need of psychosocial support both before and after transplantation."

A multivariate analysis using the logistic model was done to pinpoint factors predictive of IABP support. The prognostic factors were pre-operative functional class, presence of prior valve replacement, presence of concomitant surgery and presence of endocarditic etiology. The subgroup of 58 patients undergoing balloon counterpulsation was analysed for factors predictive of survival using a multivariate analysis of the Cox' model. Presence of aortic or mitral regurgitation was found to be the independent risk factor of mortality. Using a combination of prognostic factors, we pinpointed groups of patients at high risk of needing post-operative balloon pump counterpulsation support. The necessity of an alternative procedure for the mechanical support of the failing circulation is underlined."

Polarograms of the drug recorded from ammonium acetate buffers exhibit a single well-defined wave. The current is diffusion-controlled and proportional to the concentration. The reduction wave is due to an irreversible 8-electron reduction of the four > C=NH groups in the molecule to amino groups. The drug is strongly adsorbed on the electrode surface over a considerable potential range. Hence, the drug can be determined by polarography in the presence of other weaker surfactants often present in pharmaceutical formulations. Procedures have been proposed for pulse-polarographic determination of the drug in antiseptic cream and liquids. The proposed method is simple and accurate and does not involve time-consuming separation of the drug from insoluble constituents present in the sample."

Volume: 62 Issue: 2 Feb 01 2006,2006,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/16294337/,"Knowledge about the structural features underlying cold adaptation is important for designing enzymes of different industrial relevance. Vibriolysin from Antarctic bacterium strain 643 (VAB) is at present the only enzyme of the thermolysin family from an organism that thrive in extremely cold climate. In this study comparative sequence-structure analysis and molecular dynamics (MD) simulations were used to reveal the molecular features of cold adaptation of VAB. Amino acid sequence analysis of 44 thermolysin enzymes showed that VAB compared to the other enzymes has: (1) fewer arginines, (2) a lower Arg/(Lys + Arg) ratio, (3) a lower fraction of large aliphatic side chains, expressed by the (Ile + Leu)/(Ile + Leu + Val) ratio, (4) more methionines, (5) more serines, and (6) more of the thermolabile amino acid asparagine. A model of the catalytic domain of VAB was constructed based on homology with pseudolysin. MD simulations for 3 ns of VAB, pseudolysin, and thermolysin supported the assumption that cold-adapted enzymes have a more flexible three-dimensional (3D) structure than their thermophilic and mesophilic counterparts, especially in some loop regions. The structural analysis indicated that VAB has fewer intramolecular cation-pi electron interactions and fewer hydrogen bonds than its mesophilic (pseudolysin) and thermophilic (thermolysin) counterparts. Lysine is the dominating cationic amino acids involved in salt bridges in VAB, while arginine is dominating in thermolysin and pseudolysin. VAB has a greater volume of inaccessible cavities than pseudolysin and thermolysin. The electrostatic potentials on the surface of the catalytic domain were also more negative for VAB than for thermolysin and pseudolysin. Thus, the MD simulations, the structural patterns, and the amino acid composition of VAB relative to other enzymes of the thermolysin family suggest that VAB possesses the biophysical properties generally following adaptation to cold climate."

Signaling by activin A through canonical ALK4-ACVR2 receptor complexes activates the transcription factors SMAD2 and SMAD3. Activin A has a strong affinity to type 2 receptors, a feature that they share with some of the bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). Activin A is also elevated in myeloma patients with advanced disease and is involved in myeloma bone disease."

Volume: 6 Feb 02 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26830652/,"Within the framework of statistical learning, many behavioural studies investigated the processing of unpredicted events. However, surprisingly few neurophysiological studies are available on this topic, and no statistical learning experiment has investigated electroencephalographic (EEG) correlates of processing events with different transition probabilities. We carried out an EEG study with a novel variant of the established statistical learning paradigm. Timbres were presented in isochronous sequences of triplets. The first two sounds of all triplets were equiprobable, while the third sound occurred with either low (10%), intermediate (30%), or high (60%) probability. Thus, the occurrence probability of the third item of each triplet (given the first two items) was varied. Compared to high-probability triplet endings, endings with low and intermediate probability elicited an early anterior negativity that had an onset around 100 ms and was maximal at around 180 ms. This effect was larger for events with low than for events with intermediate probability. Our results reveal that, when predictions are based on statistical learning, events that do not match a prediction evoke an early anterior negativity, with the amplitude of this mismatch response being inversely related to the probability of such events. Thus, we report a statistical mismatch negativity (sMMN) that reflects statistical learning of transitional probability distributions that go beyond auditory sensory memory capabilities. "
619,Applications of low-cost sensing technologies for air quality monitoring and exposure assessment: How far have they gone?,29704807,Environment international. Volume: 116 07 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29704807/,"Over the past decade, a range of sensor technologies became available on the market, enabling a revolutionary shift in air pollution monitoring and assessment. With their cost of up to three orders of magnitude lower than standard/reference instruments, many avenues for applications have opened up. In particular, broader participation in air quality discussion and utilisation of information on air pollution by communities has become possible. However, many questions have been also asked about the actual benefits of these technologies. To address this issue, we conducted a comprehensive literature search including both the scientific and grey literature. We focused upon two questions: (1) Are these technologies fit for the various purposes envisaged? and (2) How far have these technologies and their applications progressed to provide answers and solutions? Regarding the former, we concluded that there is no clear answer to the question, due to a lack of: sensor/monitor manufacturers' quantitative specifications of performance, consensus regarding recommended end-use and associated minimal performance targets of these technologies, and the ability of the prospective users to formulate the requirements for their applications, or conditions of the intended use. Numerous studies have assessed and reported sensor/monitor performance under a range of specific conditions, and in many cases the performance was concluded to be satisfactory. The specific use cases for sensors/monitors included outdoor in a stationary mode, outdoor in a mobile mode, indoor environments and personal monitoring. Under certain conditions of application, project goals, and monitoring environments, some sensors/monitors were fit for a specific purpose. Based on analysis of 17 large projects, which reached applied outcome stage, and typically conducted by consortia of organizations, we observed that a sizable fraction of them (~ 30%) were commercial and/or crowd-funded. This fact by itself signals a paradigm change in air quality monitoring, which previously had been primarily implemented by government organizations. An additional paradigm-shift indicator is the growing use of machine learning or other advanced data processing approaches to improve sensor/monitor agreement with reference monitors. There is still some way to go in enhancing application of the technologies for source apportionment, which is of particular necessity and urgency in developing countries. Also, there has been somewhat less progress in wide-scale monitoring of personal exposures. However, it can be argued that with a significant future expansion of monitoring networks, including indoor environments, there may be less need for wearable or portable sensors/monitors to assess personal exposure. Traditional personal monitoring would still be valuable where spatial variability of pollutants of interest is at a finer resolution than the monitoring network can resolve."

Volume: 9 Issue: 6 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24923786/,"Responses in Atlantic salmon (Salmo salar L.) juveniles (fry) fed diets containing genetically modified maize (Bt-maize, MON810) expressing Cry1Ab protein from first-feeding were investigated during a 99-day feeding trial. Four experimental diets were made; each diet contained ∼20% maize, either Bt-maize or its near-isogenic maternal line (non-GM maize). One pair was fishmeal-based while the other pair included standard (extracted) soybean meal (SBM; 16.7% inclusion level), with the intention of investigating responses to the maize varieties in healthy fish as well as in immunologically challenged fish with SBM-induced distal intestinal inflammation, respectively. Three replicate tanks of fry (0.17±0.01 g; initial mean weight ± SEM) were fed one of the four diets and samples were taken on days 15, 36, 48 and 99. Survival, growth performance, whole body composition, digestive function, morphology of intestine, liver and skeleton, and mRNA expression of some immune and stress response parameters in the distal intestine were evaluated. After 99 days of feeding, survival was enhanced and the intended SBM-induced inflammatory response in the distal intestine of the two groups of SBM-fed fish was absent, indicating that the juvenile salmon were tolerant to SBM. Mortality, growth performance and body composition were similar in fish fed the two maize varieties. The Bt-maize fed fish, however, displayed minor but significantly decreased digestive enzyme activities of leucine aminopeptidase and maltase, as well as decreased concentration of gut bile salts, but significantly increased amylase activity at some sampling points. Histomorphological, radiographic and mRNA expression evaluations did not reveal any biologically relevant effects of Bt-maize in the gastrointestinal tract, liver or skeleton. The results suggest that the Cry1Ab protein or other compositional differences in GM Bt-maize may cause minor alterations in intestinal responses in juvenile salmon, but without affecting overall survival, growth performance, development or health.

For variceal bleeding, band ligation is the method of choice in the elective setting, although injection therapy still has a role in acute bleeding. Histoacryl remains preferable for fundic varices in most parts of the world. For peptic ulcer bleeds, injection therapy should be combined with at least one 'mechanical' modality, thermal treatment or clipping. In rebleeding, a single endoscopic retreatment can be attempted, but alternative approaches must be considered. Acute lower GI bleeding is primarily a diagnostic challenge but, if the focus is found, the regular techniques for haemostasis can usually be applied. If small bowel haemorrhage is suspected after upper and lower endoscopy, capsule endoscopy and balloon enteroscopy offer make it possible to address even small bowel foci."

Microscopic slides and histopathological reports from 311 consecutive pancreatoduodenectomies (1980-2004) were reviewed, including 104 adenocarcinomas (1980-1997) resected before and 123 adenocarcinomas (1998-2004) resected after standardizing histopathology. Histopathological factors were re-evaluated for all primary adenocarcinomas (n = 227). The most frequent histological types were pancreatobiliary-type (n = 145) and intestinal-type (n = 73). Standardized histopathology was associated with sampling more blocks and nodes (p < 0.001), and with more frequent identification of non-pancreatic tumour origin, nodal and margin involvement, perineural infiltration, and poor differentiation (p < 0.05). Standardized evaluation was necessary to discriminate between prognostic groups with respect to perineural infiltration and tumour size, but not to identify disparate prognostic subgroups with respect to nodal and margin involvement. Nodal involvement (N1 vs N0, p < 0.001) and histological type (pancreatobiliary vs intestinal, p < 0.001) were independent prognostic factors after pancreatoduodenectomy. Histopathological evaluation should be standardized to provide reliable prognostic estimates and to discriminate between prognostic subgroups. Lymph node involvement and histological type are independent prognostic factors after pancreatoduodenectomy for adenocarcinoma."

Volume: 65 Issue: 8 08 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27207510/,"Ectopic lipid accumulation in the liver is an almost universal feature of human and rodent models of generalized lipodystrophy and is also a common feature of type 2 diabetes, obesity, and metabolic syndrome. Here we explore the progression of fatty liver disease using a mouse model of lipodystrophy created by a fat-specific knockout of the insulin receptor (F-IRKO) or both IR and insulin-like growth factor 1 receptor (F-IR/IGFRKO). These mice develop severe lipodystrophy, diabetes, hyperlipidemia, and fatty liver disease within the first weeks of life. By 12 weeks of age, liver demonstrated increased reactive oxygen species, lipid peroxidation, histological evidence of balloon degeneration, and elevated serum alanine aminotransferase and aspartate aminotransferase levels. In these lipodystrophic mice, stored liver lipids can be used for energy production, as indicated by a marked decrease in liver weight with fasting and increased liver fibroblast growth factor 21 expression and intact ketogenesis. By 52 weeks of age, liver accounted for 25% of body weight and showed continued balloon degeneration in addition to inflammation, fibrosis, and highly dysplastic liver nodules. Progression of liver disease was associated with improvement in blood glucose levels, with evidence of altered expression of gluconeogenic and glycolytic enzymes. However, these mice were able to mobilize stored glycogen in response to glucagon. Feeding F-IRKO and F-IR/IGFRKO mice a high-fat diet for 12 weeks accelerated the liver injury and normalization of blood glucose levels. Thus, severe fatty liver disease develops early in lipodystrophic mice and progresses to advanced nonalcoholic steatohepatitis with highly dysplastic liver nodules. The liver injury is propagated by lipotoxicity and is associated with improved blood glucose levels."

A comparison group of 25-year-olds (n = 51) was also included. Analyses of variance showed that the benefits of participation in school-based F programs seem to have been lost. It appears that these caries-preventive programs have delayed rather than prevented caries and that F toothpaste and other caries-preventive efforts have been insufficient to avert a substantial caries activity during the follow-up period."

Second, phonological awareness predicted spelling difficulties similarly across orthographies. Third, preschool and kindergarten RAN was a significant predictor of reading and spelling difficulties at both Grades 1 and 2 across orthographies. The authors conclude that phonological awareness diminishes as a predictor of reading difficulties in transparent orthographies after the first years of schooling, that RAN is a better long-term predictor of reading difficulties, and that phonological awareness is associated with spelling difficulties similarly in transparent and opaque orthographies."

We circumvented this problem by using a DNA sequencing approach. Cores were drilled from a Devonian arcosic sandstone rock harboring the crustose lichen Ophioparma ventosa (L.) Norman on the surface. The cores were cut vertically, and DNA was extracted from the pulverized rock slices. A series of polymerase chain reactions using fungal-specific primers as well as Ophioparma ventosa specific primers were employed to amplify the internal transcribed spacer region of the nuclear ribosomal DNA. The results show that hyphae of O. ventosa penetrate approximately 10-12 mm into the rock. Consequently, the hyphal layer formed by the lichen fungus inside the rock could be 7-12 times as thick as the symbiotic thallus at the surface of the rock. In addition, eight non-lichenized fungal taxa and five that could not be identified to species were encountered. One fungal species in the order Helotiales occurs in six of the eight cores. The significance of these results to the colonization and weathering of rock by lichenized fungi is discussed."

Using a multifaceted approach, we analysed the structure and metabolic capabilities within a biofilm growing on the surface of a black smoker chimney in the Loki's Castle vent field. Imaging revealed the presence of rod-shaped Bacteroidetes growing as ectobionts on long, sheathed microbial filaments (> 100 μm) affiliated with the Sulfurovum genus within Epsilonproteobacteria. The filaments were composed of a thick (> 200 nm) stable polysaccharide, representing a substantial fraction of organic carbon produced by primary production. An integrated -omics approach enabled us to assess the metabolic potential and in situ metabolism of individual taxonomic and morphological groups identified by imaging. Specifically, we provide evidence that organotrophic Bacteroidetes attach to and glide along the surface of Sulfurovum filaments utilizing organic polymers produced by the lithoautotrophic Sulfurovum. Furthermore, in situ expression of acetyl-CoA synthetase by Sulfurovum suggested the ability to assimilate acetate, indicating recycling of organic matter in the biofilm. This study expands our understanding of the lifestyles of Epsilonproteobacteria in hydrothermal vents, their metabolic properties and co-operative interactions in deep-sea hydrothermal vent food webs."

Men and women aged 71 to 77 from two population based health studies in Norway (1999-2001) were followed for a median period of 7.3 years with respect to hip fractures. The study was designed as a case-cohort study. P1NP and 25(OH)D were analysed in frozen serum samples obtained at baseline in hip fracture patients (n=340) and in randomly selected sex stratified sub-cohorts. Bone mineral density was measured by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA) in a subset of participants. Cox proportional hazards regression with inverse probability weighting and robust variance was performed. No significant correlation between 25(OH)D and P1NP was found. A negative correlation between P1NP and BMD was observed in women (Rho=-0.36, p=0.001). A similar trend was observed in men. No association between quartiles of P1NP and rate of subsequent hip fractures was found. Spline analyses suggested a higher rate of hip fracture at P1NP levels above 60 μg/L in both men and women. A higher hip fracture rate, which was independent of BMD, was also indicated in women with very low levels of P1NP."

B. miyamotoi was detected at all sites and throughout the period of questing activity, with infection prevalence (≤1.26%) similar to what has been seen in other European countries. Detection of the relapsing fever spirochete at all locations indicates a wide distribution in southern Norway. This is the first report of B. miyamotoi prevalence in ticks collected from Norway. As not much is known about the spatiotemporal dynamics of this relatively recently discovered pathogen, the conclusions of this study significantly add to the knowledge regarding B. miyamotoi in this region.

Volume: 131 Issue: 3 Jun 2009",2009,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19232508/,"Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous syndrome characterized by defective immunoglobulin production and high frequency of bacterial infections, autoimmunity and manifestations of chronic inflammation. The urokinase plasminogen activator (uPA), its cell bound and soluble receptor (uPAR, suPAR) have complex biological functions involving innate immune defense mechanisms and regulation of inflammation. Based on this dual role, we hypothesized that the uPA system could be affected in CVID, and examined expression of components of the uPA system in subgroups of CVID. All CVID-patients had increased plasma levels of suPAR with particularly high levels in those with splenomegaly and thrombocytopenia. Plasma uPA levels were also raised in these patients, and both suPAR and uPA levels correlated with the monocyte activation marker neopterin. Monocytes from CVID patients had increased expression of uPAR. We show an increased activation of the uPA system possibly contributing to the inflammatory phenotype seen in subgroups of CVID patients."

Volume: 78 Issue: 1 Pt 1 Jul 2008",2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18763936/,"Assuming the conventional Casimir setting with two thick parallel perfectly conducting plates of large extent with a homogeneous and isotropic medium between them, we discuss the physical meaning of the electromagnetic field energy W disp when the intervening medium is weakly dispersive but nondissipative. The presence of dispersion means that the energy density contains terms of the form d[omega epsilon(omega)]/d omega and d[omega mu(omega)]/d omega . We find that, as W disp refers thermodynamically to a nonclosed physical system, it is not to be identified with the internal thermodynamic energy U following from the free energy F , or the electromagnetic energy W , when the last-mentioned quantities are calculated without such dispersive derivatives. To arrive at this conclusion, we adopt a model in which the system is a capacitor, linked to an external self-inductance L such that stationary oscillations become possible. Therewith the model system becomes a nonclosed one. As an introductory step, we review the meaning of the nondispersive energies, F , U , and W . As a final topic, we consider an anomaly connected with local surface divergences encountered in Casimir energy calculations for higher space-time dimensions, D>4 , and discuss briefly its dispersive generalization. This kind of application is essentially a generalization of the treatment of Alnes [J. Phys. A 40, F315 (2007)] to the case of a medium-filled cavity between two hyperplanes."

Volume: 325 Issue: 1 Sep 01 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18538336/,"Alkylsiloxane and perfluoroalkylsiloxane monolayers are prepared on siliceous surfaces using the techniques of Langmuir-Blodgett deposition and solid-liquid chemical adsorption. Acid-catalyzed hydrolysis and polycondensation reactions provide two-dimensional siloxane networks at the liquid-vapor interface, which can be compressed to mean molecular areas of approximately 22 and approximately 32 A(2) for pendent hydrocarbon and fluorocarbon chains, respectively. Subsequent Langmuir-Blodgett transfer onto glass substrates at moderate surface pressures leads to compact monolayers for single-component precursors, while mixed alkyl- and perfluoroalkylsilanes produce nonhomogeneous films characterized by transfer ratios greater than unity. As an alternate monolayer preparation technique, silane polymerization was performed directly on siliceous surfaces via a chemical adsorption mechanism. XPS analysis of a chemically adsorbed 1H,1H,2H,2H-perfluorodecylsiloxane film confirms a single adsorbed monolayer thickness in which the pendent fluoroalkyl chains align nonperpendicularly with respect to the surface. The surface free energy was determined to be 11.4 dyn cm(-1) based on static contact angle measurements. AFM imaging shows the presence of surface defects due to oligomer deposition during the drying process. The use of solubilized trichloro-based silane coupling agents under anhydrous conditions is shown to produce surfaces with a minimal number of surface defects. The presence of undissolved silane material in the bulk solution significantly increases the number of surface defects."

Fifteen patients were interviewed 3-5 weeks after transplantation. The results are presented in the following themes: (i) general contentment with the hospital stay, (ii) physical discomfort, (iii) dreams, nightmares and hallucinations, (iv) Comedowns experienced during rejection of the transplant and (v) Other psychological/mental reactions. A major result from our study is patients' own descriptions of comedowns experienced during rejection of the transplant, and the seemingly little consolation and support the patients received. Another major result is patients' own descriptions of dreams, nightmares and hallucinations, which are not fully described from the patients' own perspective while still in hospital."

Volume: 11 Issue: 1 Mar 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15747589/,"Frailty models are often used to model heterogeneity in survival analysis. The most common frailty model has an individual intensity which is a product of a random factor and a basic intensity common to all individuals. This paper uses the compound Poisson distribution as the random factor. It allows some individuals to be non-susceptible, which can be useful in many settings. In some diseases, one may suppose that a number of families have an increased susceptibility due to genetic circumstances. Then, it is logical to use a frailty model where the individuals within each family have some shared factor, while individuals between families have different factors. This can be attained by randomizing the Poisson parameter in the compound Poisson distribution. To our knowledge, this is a new distribution. The power variance function distributions are used for the Poisson parameter. The subsequent appearing distributions are studied in some detail, both regarding appearance and various statistical properties. An application to infant mortality data from the Medical Birth Registry of Norway is included, where the model is compared to more traditional shared frailty models."

Second- harmonic generation and the ability to suppress near field echoes are compared. Each transducer configuration is defined by a chosen f-number and focal depth, and the transmit pressure is estimated to not exceed a mechanical index of 1.2. The medium resembles homogeneous muscle tissue with nonlinear elasticity and power-law attenuation. To improve computational efficiency, the KZK equation is utilized, and all transducers are circular-symmetric. Previous literature shows that second-harmonic generation is proportional to the square of the transmit pressure, and that transducer configurations with different transmit frequencies, but equal aperture and focal depth in terms of wavelengths, generate identical second-harmonic fields in terms of shape. Results verify this for a medium with attenuation f1. For attenuation f1.1, deviations are found, and the high frequency subsequently performs worse than the low frequency. The results suggest that high frequencies are less able to suppress near-field echoes in the presence of a heterogeneous body wall than low frequencies."

Their morphologic features were intermediate between Meth A and macrophages. By taking advantage of a semiallogeneic experimental system by inoculation of Meth A cells from BALB/c (H-2 K(d)) into (BALB.K x BALB/c) F(1) (H-2(k/d)), hybrid cells from these tumors could be shown to express MHC antigens of both the Meth A and the host haplotypes.

Social class, drug use and indicators of 'the model child' (high grades, high occupational aspirations and much homework) were not related to eating problems. Logistic regression analyses identified perceived obesity as the strongest associated factor, followed by gender, depression, excessive exercise and unstable self-perceptions. In addition, adopting idols with perfect bodies, body dissatisfaction, low self-worth, feminine sex-role orientation, lack of parental care, early pubertal timing, age and number of alcohol intoxications all added to the probability of eating problems. About 6% perceived themselves as obese in spite of subnormal BMI. Such misperceptions increased the risk of high scores on EAT."

Volume: 66 Issue: 11 Nov 2012,2012,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23106709/,"The balance between stabilizing selection and migration of maladapted individuals has formerly been modeled using a variety of quantitative genetic models of increasing complexity, including models based on a constant expressed genetic variance and models based on normality. The infinitesimal model can accommodate nonnormality and a nonconstant genetic variance as a result of linkage disequilibrium. It can be seen as a parsimonious one-parameter model that approximates the underlying genetic details well when a large number of loci are involved. Here, the performance of this model is compared to several more realistic explicit multilocus models, with either two, several or a large number of alleles per locus with unequal effect sizes. Predictions for the deviation of the population mean from the optimum are highly similar across the different models, so that the non-Gaussian infinitesimal model forms a good approximation. It does, however, generally estimate a higher genetic variance than the multilocus models, with the difference decreasing with an increasing number of loci. The difference between multilocus models depends more strongly on the effective number of loci, accounting for relative contributions of loci to the variance, than on the number of alleles per locus."

Sediment cores retrieved from the inner fjord contain layers of mine tailings up to 9-cm thick, 3-9cm below the seafloor. Spreading of the tailing-related metal Cu and particles is limited to the inner fjord and to a 2cm layer in one core from the outer fjord. Two interrelated factors, fjord morphology and sedimentation rate, controlled the distribution of contaminant-laden tailings in the fjord. The mobility of Cu from buried contaminated sediments to the sediment-water interface in the inner fjord indicates that benthic communities have been continuously exposed to elevated Cu concentrations for nearly four decades."

In this chapter, we describe a classification system for meningococcal disease based on the nature of the clinical symptoms. Meningococci invade the subarachnoid space and cause meningitis in as many as 50-70% of patients. The bacteremic phase is moderate in patients with meningitis and mild systemic meningococcemia but graded high in patients with septic shock. Three landmark studies using this classification system and comprising 862 patients showed that 37-49% developed meningitis without shock, 10-18% shock without meningitis, 7-12% shock and meningitis, and 18-33% had mild meningococcemia without shock or meningitis. N. meningitidis lipopolysaccharide (LPS) is the principal trigger of the innate immune system via activation of the Toll-like receptor 4-MD2 cell surface receptor complex on myeloid and nonmyeloid human cells. The intracellular signals are conveyed via MyD88-dependent and -independent pathways altering the expression of >4,600 genes in target cells such as monocytes. However, non-LPS molecules contribute to inflammation, but 10-100-fold higher concentrations are required to reach the same responses as induced by LPS. Activation of the complement and coagulation systems is related to the bacterial load in the circulation and contributes to the development of shock, organ dysfunction, thrombus formation, bleeding, and long-term complications in patients. Despite rapid intervention and advances in patient intensive care, why as many as 30% of patients with systemic meningococcal disease develop massive meningococcemia leading to shock and death is still not understood."

The patients had been referred to an interdisciplinary clinic because of extensive hypodontia, missing 8.4 teeth on average. All persisting primary mandibular molars were included in the study, as no decision had been made as to whether they should be kept or extracted. Panoramic radiographs were used to assess infraocclusion, resorption of the mesial and distal roots and whether restorations were present. Clinically significant infraocclusion was observed in 43.6 per cent of the patients and classified as severe in 18.8 per cent. The mesial and distal root exhibited no resorption in 18.9 and 33.3 per cent, respectively (P = 0.01). Most primary molars had no restorations (78.4 per cent). A significant correlation was found between root resorption and infraocclusion. Age was found to be weakly but significantly correlated with root resorption and infraocclusion. No significant relationship was observed between gender and either infraocclusion or root resorption. In conclusion, infraocclusion was estimated to be a more critical factor for the prognosis of retained primary molars than root resorption. "

Volume: 63 Sep 2017,2017,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28502405/,"Sedentary behavior is defined as sitting or lying with low energy expenditure. Humans in industrialized societies spend an increasing amount of time in sedentary behaviors every day. This has been associated with detrimental health outcomes. Despite a growing interest in the health effects of sedentary behavior at work, associations remain unclear, plausibly due to poor and diverse methods for assessing sedentary behavior. Thus, good practice guidance for researchers and practitioners on how to assess occupational sedentary behavior are needed. The aim of this paper is to provide a practical guidance for practitioners and researchers on how to assess occupational sedentary behavior. Ambulatory systems for use in field applications (wearables) are a promising approach for sedentary behavior assessment. Many different small-size consumer wearables, with long battery life and high data storage capacity are commercially available today. However, no stand-alone commercial system is able to assess sedentary behavior in accordance with its definition. The present paper offers decision support for practitioners and researchers in selecting wearables and data collection strategies for their purpose of study on sedentary behavior. Valid and reliable assessment of occupational sedentary behavior is currently not easy. Several aspects need to be considered in the decision process on how to assess sedentary behavior. There is a need for development of a cheap and easily useable wearable for assessment of occupational sedentary behavior by researchers and practitioners."

Volume: 326 Issue: 1-3 Jun 29 2004,2004,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15142774/,"Aboveground concentrations of Cd and Zn in various grazing plants at three stages of the growing season are reported. The plants were collected at a natural habitat exposed to extensive atmospheric deposition of heavy metals from other parts of Europe. Concentrations of both metals varied considerably among species, also among morphologically similar species growing in the same soil. The two metals correlated in the material as a whole, but the concentration variations were most pronounced for Cd. There were also seasonal variations (generally a concentration reduction during spring). Transfer of metals from twigs to leaves seemed to differ between 'high' and 'low' metal accumulators. The inter-species and seasonal variations in plant metal concentrations complicate assessments of metal exposure to grazing animals through diet. By using diet information from a study conducted in an area similar to the present one, we roughly estimated a daily intake of 1-2 mg Cd for moose (Alces alces) in the autumn. Among the plant species investigated, Populus and Salix species were by far the most important Cd contributors. In areas where high Cd accumulators grow more widely, the daily Cd intake by moose could be as high as 7 mg or more."

In this study we focused on the kinetics and fates of ammonia, urea and uric acid. The results showed that ammonia (T(Amm): NH(3)+NH(4)(+)), and urea-N contents increased during final oocyte maturation. Urea-N excretion dominated the total nitrogenous end product formation in early embryos. Later, yolk T(Amm) levels increased in embryos and ammonia excretion was low. In the last part of the embryonic stage T(Amm) accumulation dominated, and was apparently due to yolk storage. Around hatching, the larval body tissues (larva with yolk-sac removed) accounted for 68% of whole animal urea-N accumulation, while T(Amm) levels increased predominately by yolk accumulation. Afterwards, ammonia excretion dominated and uric acid accumulation accounted for less than 1%. Urea, synthesised either through the ornithine-urea cycle, argininolysis or uricolysis, accounted for approximately 8% of total nitrogenous end product formation in yolk-sac larvae. The results suggested that a sequence occurred regarding which nitrogenous end products dominated and how they were handled. Urea excretion dominated in early embryos (<7 dPF), followed by yolk ammonia accumulation (7-12 dPF), and finally, ammonia excretion dominated in later embryonic and yolk-sac larval stages (>12 dPF)."

680,Academic learning for specialist nurses: a grounded theory study.,25240945,Nurse education in practice. Volume: 14 Issue: 6 Nov 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25240945/,"The aim was to explore the major concerns of specialist nurses pertaining to academic learning during their education and initial professional career. Specialist nursing education changed in tandem with the European educational reform in 2007. At the same time, greater demands were made on the healthcare services to provide evidence-based and safe patient-care. These changes have influenced specialist nursing programmes and consequently the profession. Grounded Theory guided the study. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire with open-ended questions distributed at the end of specialist nursing programmes in 2009 and 2010. Five universities were included. Further, individual, pair and group interviews were used to collect data from 12 specialist nurses, 5-14 months after graduation. A major concern for specialist nurses was that academic learning should be ""meaningful"" for their professional future. The specialist nurses' ""meaningful academic learning process"" was characterised by an ambivalence of partly believing in and partly being hesitant about the significance of academic learning and partly receiving but also lacking support. Specialist nurses were influenced by factors in two areas: curriculum and healthcare context. They felt that the outcome of contribution to professional confidence was critical in making academic learning meaningful. "

Volume: 12 Issue: 1,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17343478/,"Light and heat distributions are measured in a rat glioma model used in photodynamic therapy. A fiber delivering 632-nm light is fixed in the brain of anesthetized BDIX rats. Fluence rates are measured using calibrated isotropic probes that are positioned stereotactically. Mathematical models are then used to derive tissue optical properties, enabling calculation of fluence rate distributions for general tumor and light application geometries. The fluence rates in tumor-free brains agree well with the models based on diffusion theory and Monte Carlo simulation. In both cases, the best fit is found for absorption and reduced scattering coefficients of 0.57 and 28 cm(-1), respectively. In brains with implanted BT(4)C tumors, a discrepancy between diffusion and Monte Carlo-derived two-layer models is noted. Both models suggest that tumor tissue has higher absorption and less scattering than normal brain. Temperatures are measured by inserting thermocouples directly into tumor-free brains. A model based on diffusion theory and the bioheat equation is found to be in good agreement with the experimental data and predict a thermal penetration depth of 0.60 cm in normal rat brain. The predicted parameters can be used to estimate the fluences, fluence rates, and temperatures achieved during photodynamic therapy."
682,The hypotriglyceridemic effect of eicosapentaenoic acid in rats is reflected in increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation followed by diminished lipogenesis.,8377581,Lipids. Volume: 28 Issue: 8 Aug 1993,1993,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8377581/,"The effect of eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) on fatty acid oxidation and on key enzymes of triglyceride metabolism and lipogenesis was investigated in the liver of rats. Repeated administration of EPA to normolipidemic rats resulted in a time-dependent decrease in plasma triglycerides, phospholipids and cholesterol. The triglyceride-lowering effect was observed after one day of feeding whereas lowering of plasma cholesterol and phospholipids was observed after five days of treatment. The triglyceride content of liver was reduced after two-day treatment. At that time, increased mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation occurred whereas mitochondrial and microsomal glycerophosphate acyltransferase was inhibited. The phosphatidate phosphohydrolase activity was unchanged. Adenosine triphosphate:citrate lyase, acetyl-CoA carboxylase, fatty acid synthetase and glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase were inhibited during the 15 d of EPA treatment whereas peroxisomal beta-oxidation was increased. At one day of feeding, however, when the hypotriglyceridemic effect was established, the lipogenic enzyme activities were reduced to the same extent in palmitic acid-treated animals as in EPA-treated rats. In cultured rat hepatocytes, the oxidation of [14C]palmitic acid to carbon dioxide and acid-soluble products was stimulated in the presence of EPA. These results suggest that the instant hypolipidemia in rats given EPA could be explained at least in part by a sudden increase in mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation, thereby reducing the availability of fatty acids for lipid synthesis in the liver for export, e.g., in the form of very low density lipoproteins, even before EPA induced peroxisomal fatty acid oxidation, reduced triglyceride biosynthesis and diminished lipogenesis."

The study was conducted in Norway, a setting characterized by a comprehensive welfare system and strong employment protection legislation. Methods A randomized controlled multicenter trial including 410 participants was conducted. The intervention group received IPS according to the IPS manual. The control group received high-quality usual care. The main outcome was competitive employment at 12- and 18-months follow-up, based on objective registry data. Changes in mental health and health-related quality of life were secondary outcomes. Results At 12-months follow-up, 36.6% of participants in the IPS group and 27.1% of participants in the control group were in competitive employment, while the difference was slightly higher (37.4% versus 27.1%) at 18-months follow-up. Furthermore, IPS yielded positive effects on all the secondary outcomes compared to the control group (all P<0.05). Conclusions The IPS model of supported employment was superior to high-quality usual care on both vocational and non-vocational outcomes for people with moderate-to-severe mental illness, even in a policy context characterized by high job security and a comprehensive welfare system."

Rodents and ruminants are abundant herbivore species in most Arctic ecosystems, many of which are experiencing particularly rapid climate change. Their different life-history characteristics, with the exception of their trophic position, suggest that they should show different responses to environmental variation. Here we show that the only mammalian herbivores on the Arctic islands of Svalbard, reindeer (Rangifer tarandus) and sibling voles (Microtus levis), exhibit strong synchrony in population parameters. This synchrony is due to rain-on-snow events that cause ground ice and demonstrates that climate impacts can be similarly integrated and expressed in species with highly contrasting life histories. The finding suggests that responses of wildlife populations to climate variability and change might be more consistent in Polar regions than elsewhere owing to the strength of the climate impact and the simplicity of the ecosystem."

Outbreak investigations were initiated independently in the two countries. In Denmark, a total of 37 cases were identified, and multiple findings of the outbreak strain in pork and pigs within the same supply chain led to the identification of pork in various forms as the source. In Norway, ten cases were identified, and the outbreak investigation quickly indicated meat bought in Sweden as the probable source and the Swedish authorities were alerted. Investigations in Sweden identified four human cases and two isolates from minced meat with the distinct profile. Subsequent trace-back of the meat showed that it most likely originated from Denmark. Through international alert from Norway on 19 December, it became clear that the Danish and Norwegian outbreak strains were identical and, later on, that the source of the outbreaks in all three countries could be traced back to Danish pork. MLVA was instrumental in linking the outbreaks in the different countries and tracing the source. This outbreak illustrates that good international communication channels, early alerting mechanisms, inter-sectoral collaboration between public health and food safety authorities and harmonised molecular typing tools are important for effective identification and management of cross-border outbreaks. Differences in legal requirements for food safety in neighbouring countries may be a challenge in terms of communication with consumers in areas where cross-border shopping is common."

During 1983-1987, 114 drivers were arrested in Norway with blood toluene concentrations (BTCs) greater than 10 microM. Only four of these drivers were women. The age range was 15-34 years, and the mean age was 21. The mean BTC was 109 microM. There was no simple relation between blood toluene concentration and degree of impairment, however, most drivers with BTCs greater than 100 microM were considered as impaired or probably impaired by toluene. In a five year prospective study of rearrests among drivers arrested for driving after toluene sniffing, 12 out of 15 drivers were rearrested. They were responsible for 40 cases of suspected driving under influence of toluene, alcohol, or other drugs. The blood levels of toluene determined in this study must be regarded as minimum concentrations, since the toluene concentration fell rapidly in samples stored at 4 degrees C or 23 degrees C. Blood samples from drivers suspected of driving under influence of toluene must therefore be kept frozen."

Volume: 85 Aug 2015,2015,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26164108/,"Causal explanations for the dramatic changes that occurred during the evolution of the human hip focus largely on selection for bipedal function and locomotor efficiency. These hypotheses rest on two critical assumptions. The first-that these anatomical changes served functional roles in bipedalism-has been supported in numerous analyses showing how postcranial changes likely affected locomotion. The second-that morphological changes that did play functional roles in bipedalism were the result of selection for that behavior-has not been previously explored and represents a major gap in our understanding of hominin hip evolution. Here we use evolutionary quantitative genetic models to test the hypothesis that strong directional selection on many individual aspects of morphology was responsible for the large differences observed across a sample of fossil hominin hips spanning the Plio-Pleistocene. Our approach uses covariance among traits and the differences between relatively complete fossils to estimate the net selection pressures that drove the major transitions in hominin hip evolution. Our findings show a complex and changing pattern of natural selection drove hominin hip evolution, and that many, but not all, traits hypothesized to play functional roles in bipedalism evolved as a direct result of natural selection. While the rate of evolutionary change for all transitions explored here does not exceed the amount expected if evolution was occurring solely through neutral processes, it was far above rates of evolution for morphological traits in other mammalian groups. Given that stasis is the norm in the mammalian fossil record, our results suggest that large shifts in the adaptive landscape drove hominin evolution. "

In the absence of ethanol only hexagonal mesoporous silica with ellipsoidal and spherical morphology are obtained. The presence of ethanol drives a mesophase transformation from hexagonal to mixed hexagonal/cubic, further to purely cubic, and finally to a mixed cubic/lamellar. This is accompanied by a morphology evolution involving a mixture of ellipses/spheres, regular rods, uniform spheres, and finally a mixture of spheres/flakes. Preserving the three-dimensional (3D) cubic MCM-48 structure, use of a small amount of ethanol is beneficial to the improvement of the monodispersity of the CMSNs. Moreover, the quality of the CMSNs can also be controlled by changing the surfactant concentration or adjusting the stirring rate. All MSNs were characterized using powder X-ray diffraction, transmission electron microscopy, scanning electron microscopy, and N2 physisorption, indicating highly long-range ordered pore arrays, high specific surface areas (max. 1173 m2g-1) as well as high pore volumes (max. 1.14 cm3g-1). The monodispersity of the CMSNs was verified by statistical particle size distribution from SEM (scanning electron microscopy)/TEM (transmission electron microscopy) images and DLS (dynamic light scattering). The mesophase transformation can be rationalized on the basis of an ethanol-driven change of the surfactant packing structure and charge matching at the surfactant/silicate interface. The corresponding morphology evolution can be elucidated by an ethanol-controlled hydrolysis rate of TEOS and degree of condensation of oligomeric silicate species via a nucleation and growth process."

713,Assays for oxidative stress and antioxidant status: applications to research into the biological effectiveness of polyphenols.,15640489,The American journal of clinical nutrition. Volume: 81 Issue: 1 Suppl 01 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15640489/,"Oxidative stress is a factor in many human diseases, as either cause or effect. A convenient biomarker of oxidative stress is the extent of oxidation of bases in DNA (although measures of lipid or protein oxidation may be equally informative). 8-Oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine or the corresponding nucleoside is most often measured, either chromatographically (gas chromatography-mass spectrometry, HPLC with electrochemical detection, or HPLC-tandem mass spectrometry) or enzymically, with the use of the enzyme formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase to convert 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine to DNA breaks, which are detected with alkaline elution, alkaline unwinding, or the comet assay. Estimates of background levels of 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine in normal human cells vary 1000-fold, depending on the technique used. Gas chromatography-mass spectrometry is particularly prone to oxidation of samples during derivatization, whereas HPLC suffers from this artifact to a lesser degree. In a recent interlaboratory study that measured the same samples of human cells, median values obtained with HPLC with electrochemical detection and with formamidopyrimidine DNA glycosylase differed by approximately 10-fold. There are still questions regarding the actual level of damage, but it is probably approximately one 8-oxo-7,8-dihydroguanine residue per 10(6) guanines. Assays for antioxidant protection against oxidative damage generally depend on measurements of decreases in a marker of oxidation. Potential dietary antioxidants can be screened with in vitro antioxidant assays or tested in cell culture systems. The best test, however, is in humans. The total antioxidant capacity of plasma is generally insensitive to dietary supplementation with antioxidants or antioxidant-rich foods. An increase in the resistance of lymphocyte DNA to oxidation in vitro is commonly seen, however, and a decrease in endogenous oxidation of DNA may be detected, especially after prolonged supplementation."

Volume: 37 Issue: 11 Nov 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27696916/,"Psychotropic drugs, particularly antipsychotic types, are a cornerstone of the treatment of people with psychosis. Despite numerous studies showing that drug treatment with psychotropic drugs initially alleviates psychiatric symptoms, the proportion of people with mental health problems and symptoms that do not follow doctors' prescriptions, thus exhibiting so-called non-adherence, is considerable. Non-adherence is predominantly seen as a clinical feature and as a patient characteristic that is especially due to patients' poor understanding that they are ill. There is also a widespread notion that non-adherence is of great disadvantage to the patient. This article is based on interviews with 19 persons diagnosed with psychosis. It challenges the notion of patients being either adherent or non-adherent to the doctor's orders. The findings show that persons with psychosis are active agents when it comes to adjusting medication. The interviewees created their own strategies to gain power over treatment with psychotropic drugs. The most common strategies were to adjust the doses or take breaks of varying lengths from the medication. These deviations from prescriptions were important to conceal, not only from their own psychiatrists, but from all psychiatric staff."

Volume: 9 Issue: 2 Apr 1994,1994,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8008432/,"The purpose of this study was to find whether a glycerolphosphate-containing lipoteichoic acid prepared from Streptococcus sobrinus OMZ 176 cells would activate the classical pathway of complement while in solution. Reference activators were lipopolysaccharide from Escherichia coli 0111:B4 and heat-aggregated immunoglobulin G. Serum samples were taken from healthy students. Analysis through crossed immunoelectrophoresis showed that lipoteichoic acid caused an almost complete dissociation of the C1qrs macromolecule. All activators decreased the area of and slowed the electrophoretic mobility of the C4 protein peaks, with lipoteichoic acid causing the most pronounced alterations. Electroimmunoassays showed that lipoteichoic acid separately, yielded detectable amounts of free C1r2s2 subunits; it also generated significantly more trimer complexes between C1r, C1s and C1 inhibitor (C1INH) than did the other two activators. Lipoteichoic acid was, however, a comparatively weak inducer of tetramer C1INH-C1r-C1s-C1INH complexes. Analysis through Western blotting showed that all activators accelerated consumption of C1r, induced complex formations between C1INH and C1s and produced cleavage products of C2. Altogether, the immunochemical analysis gave clear evidence of classical pathway activation by lipoteichoic acid, but its activation profile differed from those seen with lipopolysaccharide and aggregated immunoglobulin G."

The 3-item TED-QOL and 16-item GO-QOL, which assess quality of life (QoL) in TED, were administered to consecutive patients undergoing rehabilitative surgery. The questionnaires were completed pre-and post-operatively to assess sensitivity (ability to discriminate between different surgical groups) and responsiveness (ability to detect within patient changes over time).56 patients underwent 69 procedures for TED (29 orbital decompressions, 15 strabismus operations, 25 eyelid procedures). The differences in scores between the three types of surgery (a measure of sensitivity) were statistically significant at the 5% level pre-operatively and post-operatively for all 3 TED-QOL scales and for both GO-QOL scales, but much more so for the TED-QOL scales in each case. The within-patient changes between the pre- and post-operative scores for the same subjects (a measure of responsiveness) were statistically very highly significant for the TED-QOL overall and appearance scales for each of the surgeries. The pre- and post-operative difference for the TED-QOL functioning scale was highly statistically significant for strabismus surgery but not for decompression or lid surgery. The change between the pre- and post-operative scores for the GO-QOL was significant for the functioning scale with strabismus and lid surgery, and was highly significant for the appearance scale with lid surgery but not for strabismus surgery or decompression. The 3-item TED-QOL is sensitive and responsive to rehabilitative surgery in TED and compares favorably with the lengthier GO-QOL for these parameters."

The reliability of both instruments was high (Cronbach's alpha indices > 0.95). With DAS, 90% of the fearful patients and 85% of the reference patients were correctly assigned to their appropriate group. Thus it may be concluded that, when used on a Norwegian population, DAS is a valid instrument for distinguishing fearful patients from those regularly attending dental treatment. The corresponding figures for STAI-S were 80% for the fearful patients and 79% for the reference patients. Although not developed specifically for this purpose, this instrument may therefore still validly be used to distinguish between the groups. The correlation between the instruments was 0.76, indicating that to some extent they measure the same phenomenon."

Volume: 17 Issue: 8 Dec 2000,2000,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/11127393/,"An event-free survival is currently achieved in 70-80% of children diagnosed with acute lymphocytic leukemia (ALL). A decline in the long-term sequalae from therapy is a challenge at present. Due to the high incidence of central nervous system (CNS) relapse in ALL patients, cranial irradiation was introduced as a prophylactic measure in the beginning of the 1970s. Cranial irradiation, however, may cause secondary malignancies in the CNS. In recent years neurotoxicities have been demonstrated to follow cranial irradiation in a large proportion of ALL patients. Because of these deleterious effects, most ALL protocols are limited to the combination intrathecal and intravenous methotrexate as the standard for CNS prophylaxis. In the 1970s, an intermediate dose was administered, while from the 1980s a high dose of methotrexate was combined with intrathecal methotrexate. The regular methotrexate dose of later years has been in the range of 5-8 g/m2. The intravenous methotrexate dose has actually varied from 2 to 33.6 g/m2. The highest dose, 33.6 g/m2, has been without intrathecal instillation. In a study from Norway, high-dose methotrexate (6-8 g/m2) was used, and only two (2.2%) of 89 ALL cases showed CNS relapse, both of reversible kind. In the United Kingdom, a randomized controlled study was started in 1990. Results published so far are based on a segment of cases characterized by standard risk and white blood cell count below 50 x 10(9); a 4% reduction in CNS relapse was found for high-dose methotrexate in comparison to those treated only with long-term intrathecal methotrexate. The use of methotrexate unalterably warrants some precautions. Rescue therapy with folinic acid is usually started 36 h after initiating the methotrexate infusion. Steps are also taken to secure adequate intake of fluids and alkalinization of the urine. Provided irradiation is avoided, neurotoxicities rarely occur. For regular high-dose methotrexate adverse effects mostly involve mucositis and myelosuppresion."

Volume: 11 Issue: 5 Apr 24 2018",2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29695140/,"The use of high strength steel allows the design of lighter, more slender and simpler structures due to high strength and favorable ductility. Nevertheless, the increase of yield strength does not guarantee the corresponding improvement of fatigue resistance, which becomes a major concern for engineering structure design, especially for the welded joints. The paper presents a comparison of the low cycle fatigue behaviors between 10CrNi3MoV high strength steel and its undermatched weldments. Uniaxial tension tests, Push-pull, strain-controlled fatigue tests were conducted on base metal and weldments in the strain range of 0.2⁻1.2%. The monotonic and cyclic stress-strain curves, stress-life, strain-life and energy-life in terms of these materials were analyzed for fatigue assessment of materials discrepancy. The stress-life results of base metal and undermatched weld metal exhibit cyclic softening behaviors. Furthermore, the shapes of 10CrNi3MoV steel hysteresis loops show a satisfactory Masing-type behavior, while the weld metal shows a non-Masing type behavior. Strain, plastic and total strain energy density amplitudes against the number of reversals to failure results demonstrate that the undermatched weld metal presents a higher resistance to fatigue crack initiation than 10CrNi3MoV high strength steel. Finally, fatigue fracture surfaces of specimens were compared by scanning electron microscopy to identify the differences of crack initiation and the propagation between them."

Skin pieces wrapped in aluminum paper were immersed into boiling hot water for 10, 30, or 60 s. Dermal imbibition pressure was measured with micropipettes and tissue osmometry as interstitial fluid hydrostatic pressure (Pif) and/or interstitial fluid colloid osmotic pressure (COPif). COPif was also measured in interstitial fluid sampled with intradermal wicks. Control values of Pif (micropipettes) and of COPif (wick fluid) averaged -1.5 mmHg and -17.5 mmHg, respectively. An increase in imbibition pressure was seen after thermal injury. After 10 s of heat exposure, the imbibition pressure gain was mainly due to a strongly negative hydrostatic pressure (Pif mean value -33.3 mmHg). Pif became slightly positive and COPif increasingly negative after longer exposure (mean Pif 0.3 and mean COPif -133 mmHg after 60-s exposure). Collagen degradation and water solubility increased with extension of the heat exposure time. Thermal degradation of collagen seems to be the main mechanism responsible for the generation of increased imbibition pressure."

Volume: 105 Issue: 5 Pt 2 Oct 1997,1997,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/9395120/,"Halitosis is most often caused by oral conditions. Volatile sulfur compounds (VSC), constituting the major components of oral malodor, are produced by anaerobic, gram-negative bacteria retained mainly in periodontal pockets or on the tongue dorsum. Sulfur-containing amino acids serve as substrate for these bacteria. VSC have also been found to have unfavorable effect on the tissue. The aim of this study was to examine whether normal, healthy individuals with no history of halitosis were able to produce VSC from cysteine, when applied as a mouthrinse. A further aim of the study was to investigate and compare the potential of other sulfur-containing amino acids and peptides as substrates for oral VSC production and to localize the odor-production sites. A portable sulfide monitor was used for VSC registration. Results showed that all test subjects produced high oral concentrations of VSC upon rinses with cysteine, which thus seems to be a major substrate for VSC production. The other sulfur-containing substrates had much less effect. It was found that the tongue was the major site for VSC production, and that saliva per se caused low VSC production."

Volume: 133 Issue: 3 Nov 2002",2002,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12443932/,"The present paper reviews recent studies on changes in body mass, body composition and rates of energy expenditure during the breeding season in the black-legged Kittiwake (Rissa tridactyla) on Svalbard (79 degrees N). The main characteristic of the energy budget is a pronounced decrease in body mass as well as basal metabolic rate (BMR) after the eggs have hatched. While most internal organs lose mass in direct proportion to the general decrease in body mass, the liver and kidney masses decrease to a disproportionately greater extent. Since both the liver and the kidney have high intrinsic metabolic rates, these results support an earlier notion that the reduction in body mass is an adaptation to reduce maintenance costs. Alternatively, the reduced BMR is due to a decrease in energy uptake from the gastrointestinal tract, thereby ensuring that undigested food is ready to be regurgitated to the chicks. At the end of the chick-rearing period, the field metabolic rate (FMR) reaches its highest level, probably due to an increased workload associated with chick feeding. This occurs at a time of low body mass and BMR. A pronounced increase in the metabolic scope (FMR/BMR) during the latter part of the chick-rearing period demonstrates that BMR and FMR may change independently of each other and that the ratio FMR/BMR may not be a good measure of energy stress."

735,Spatial forms and mental imagery.,19665116,Cortex; a journal devoted to the study of the nervous system and behavior. Volume: 45 Issue: 10,,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19665116/,"Four studies investigated how general mental imagery might be involved in mediating the phenomenon of 'synaesthetic' spatial forms - i.e., the experience that sequences such as months or numbers have spatial locations. In Study 1, people with spatial forms scored higher than controls on visual imagery self-report scales. This is consistent with the suggestion that strong general imagery is at least a necessary condition to experience spatial forms. However self-reported spatial imagery did not differ between groups, suggesting either that the spatial nature of forms is mediated by special synaesthetic mechanisms, or that forms are depictive visual images rather than explicit spatial models. A methodological implication of Study 1 was that a general tendency for people with spatial forms to use imagery strategies might account for some of their previously-reported behavioural differences with control groups. This concern was supported by Studies 2-4. Normal participants were encouraged to visually image the months in various spatial layouts, and spatial associations for months were tested using left/right key presses to classify month names as belonging to the first or second half of the year (Studies 2-3) or as odd/even (Study 4). Reaction times showed month-SNARC (Spatial Numerical Association of Response Codes) effects of similar magnitude to previously-reported data from spatial form participants (Price and Mentzoni, 2008). Additionally, reversing the spatial associations within instructed images was sufficient to reverse the direction of observed month-SNARC effects (i.e., positive vs negative slope), just as different spatial forms were previously shown to modulate the direction of effects (ibid.). Results challenge whether previously observed behavioural differences between spatial form and control groups need to be explained in terms of special synaesthetic mechanisms rather than intentional imagery strategies. It is argued that usually strong general imagery processes should complement synaesthetic mechanisms as possible explanations of spatial forms."

Volume: 26 Issue: 5 May 2009,2009,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/19174481/,"Oocyte hydration is a unique event in oviparous marine teleosts that provides the single-celled egg with an essential pool of water for survival during early development in the saline oceanic environment. A conserved mechanism of maturational yolk proteolysis of a neofunctionalized vitellogenin (VtgAa) has been shown to underlie the hydration event in all teleosts that spawn pelagic eggs (pelagophils), and is argued to be a key adaptation for teleost radiation in the oceanic environment 55 Ma. We have recently shown that a small pool of free amino acids (FAAs) significantly contributes to the osmolarity of the ovulated egg in an ancestral marine teleost, the Atlantic herring that spawns benthic eggs (benthophil). To determine whether multiple forms of vtg exist and whether neofunctionalization of the gene products are related to the egg FAA pool in this species, genomic sequences conserved between the exons of Atlantic herring and zebrafish were amplified. This approach identified a small polymorphic intron between exons 9 and 10 in Atlantic herring and demonstrated that two closely related major vtg transcripts (chvtgAc1 and chvtgAc2) are expressed during oogenesis. A separate polymerase chain reaction-based approach identified a more ancestral phosvitinless transcript (chvtgC). Proteomic analyses of the translated products of the major vtg forms demonstrated that the yolk proteins are similarly processed during deposition, and oocyte maturation and reveal that vtgs have duplicated but not neofunctionalized in this species. Phylogenetic analyses consistently clustered the transcripts and proteins as the basal sister group to the Ostariophysi in full congruence with the Clupeocephalan rank, and suggest that expansion of ostariophysan vtgAo1 and vtgAo2 genes occurred in a lineage-specific manner after separation from the Clupeiformes. Three-dimensional modeling of the ChvtgAc1 sequence against the resolved lamprey lipovitellin module revealed that the tertiary structure is highly conserved, with most substitutions occurring on the outside of the molecule. The data indicate that the phosvitin domain, the smallest yet reported for teleosts, and an N-terminal fragment of the lipovitellin light chain contribute to the FAA pool. The present findings thus show that yolk proteolysis and the generation of an organic osmolyte pool of FAAs was an adaptive response to spawning in seawater also for the Clupeiformes, but that this process was not evolutionarily successful in terms of biodiversity until vtg gene neofunctionalization occurred in the Acanthomorpha."

Volume: 25 Issue: 3 Apr 2005,2005,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15795018/,"Nations around the world face mounting problems in health care, including rising costs, challenges to accessing services, and wide variations in safety and quality. Several reports and surveys have clearly demonstrated that adverse events and errors pose serious threats to patient safety. It has become obvious that future health professionals will need to address such problems in the quality of patient care. This article discuss a research study examining improvement knowledge in clinical practice as experienced by nursing students with respect to a patient-centred perspective, knowledge of health-care processes, the handling of adverse events, cross-professional collaboration, and the development of new knowledge. Six focus groups were conducted, comprising a total of 27 second-year students. The resulting discourses were recorded, coded and analysed. The findings indicate a deficiency in improvement knowledge in clinical practice, and a gap between what students learn about patient care and what they observe. In addition the findings suggest that there is a need to change the culture in health care and health professional education, and to develop learning models that encourage reflection, openness, and scrutiny of underlying individual and organizational values and assumptions in health care."

The bacterial broth was distributed into smaller volumes and immediately frozen on liquid nitrogen and stored at -70 degrees C. We have tested the virulence of five different pneumococcal serotypes in BALB/c, C57BL/6, and NIHS mice using inocula prepared by this method and stored without loss of virulence for up to 4 years. Serotypes 1, 4, 5 and 8 were highly virulent for the strains of mice tested whereas type 6B showed lower virulence and a peculiar, protracted course of infection.

Volume: 12 Issue: 1 1991,1991,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/1671832/,"Fine-needle aspiration biopsies and surgical biopsies were obtained from maldescended testes of 149 consecutive men. The aspirates were subjected to quantitative DNA flow cytometry and the surgical biopsy to histological evaluation. From more than 80% of the gonads, sufficient material was obtained for both examinations. A significant hyperdiploid cell population with a mean DNA index of 1.23 (range 1.17-1.31) was found in six gonads. Hyperdiploid aneuploidy was found in gonads without, as well as with, complete spermatogenesis. In none of the six cases did the surgical biopsy show evidence of early testicular neoplasia by morphology or by immunohistochemical methods with antibodies against carcinoma in situ. This indicates that aneuploidies in maldescended testes do not necessarily indicate malignancy. It may be speculated that hyperdiploid aneuploidy is related to the development of preneoplastic lesions."

744,Human cognitive ability is influenced by genetic variation in components of postsynaptic signalling complexes assembled by NMDA receptors and MAGUK proteins.,24399044,Translational psychiatry. Volume: 4 Jan 07 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24399044/,"Differences in general cognitive ability (intelligence) account for approximately half of the variation in any large battery of cognitive tests and are predictive of important life events including health. Genome-wide analyses of common single-nucleotide polymorphisms indicate that they jointly tag between a quarter and a half of the variance in intelligence. However, no single polymorphism has been reliably associated with variation in intelligence. It remains possible that these many small effects might be aggregated in networks of functionally linked genes. Here, we tested a network of 1461 genes in the postsynaptic density and associated complexes for an enriched association with intelligence. These were ascertained in 3511 individuals (the Cognitive Ageing Genetics in England and Scotland (CAGES) consortium) phenotyped for general cognitive ability, fluid cognitive ability, crystallised cognitive ability, memory and speed of processing. By analysing the results of a genome wide association study (GWAS) using Gene Set Enrichment Analysis, a significant enrichment was found for fluid cognitive ability for the proteins found in the complexes of N-methyl-D-aspartate receptor complex; P=0.002. Replication was sought in two additional cohorts (N=670 and 2062). A meta-analytic P-value of 0.003 was found when these were combined with the CAGES consortium. The results suggest that genetic variation in the macromolecular machines formed by membrane-associated guanylate kinase (MAGUK) scaffold proteins and their interaction partners contributes to variation in intelligence.

In the experiment, nucleation, propagation, and coalescence of fractures within an elastic gelatin matrix, confined in a Hele-Shaw cell, occurred due to CO_{2} production via fermentation of sugar, and it was monitored by optical means. We first quantified how a fracture network develops, and then how intermittent fluid transport is controlled by the dynamics of opening and closing of fractures. The gas escape dynamics exhibited three characteristic behaviors: (1) Quasiperiodic release of gas with a characteristic frequency that depends on the gas production rate but not on the system size. (2) A 1/f power spectrum for the fluctuations in the total open fracture area over an intermediate range of frequencies (f), which we attribute to collective effects caused by interaction between fractures in the drainage network. (3) A 1/f^{2} power spectrum was observed at high frequencies, which can be explained by the characteristic behavior of single fractures."

A hermeneutic approach was used to analyze interviews with patients living with IBD outside hospital. Thirteen young adults 18 to 45 years of age, with IBD, resided in their home environment and were engaged in different study and work activities. Two main themes emerged from the analysis of the interviews: (1) confidence with symptoms of disease as a source to recovery and (2) nutritional recovery in different stages of IBD. The course of the disease may be turned toward regeneration using a balanced diet in a long-term management perspective. Development of a tailored diet will provide energy and act as a catalyst to enhance the adaptive immune system in the body. Embodied knowledge and recovery from IBD within the individual patient requires understanding, clinical support, and the skills of the IBD nurse, dietitian, and doctor in an interdisciplinary team collaboration.

Individual studies have shown that epigenetic modifications such as DNA methylation could contribute. Within the Pregnancy and Childhood Epigenetics (PACE) Consortium, we meta-analysed the association between pre-pregnancy maternal BMI and methylation at over 450,000 sites in newborn blood DNA, across 19 cohorts (9,340 mother-newborn pairs). We attempted to infer causality by comparing the effects of maternal versus paternal BMI and incorporating genetic variation. In four additional cohorts (1,817 mother-child pairs), we meta-analysed the association between maternal BMI at the start of pregnancy and blood methylation in adolescents. In newborns, maternal BMI was associated with small (<0.2% per BMI unit (1 kg/m2), P < 1.06 × 10-7) methylation variation at 9,044 sites throughout the genome. Adjustment for estimated cell proportions greatly attenuated the number of significant CpGs to 104, including 86 sites common to the unadjusted model. At 72/86 sites, the direction of the association was the same in newborns and adolescents, suggesting persistence of signals. However, we found evidence for acausal intrauterine effect of maternal BMI on newborn methylation at just 8/86 sites. In conclusion, this well-powered analysis identified robust associations between maternal adiposity and variations in newborn blood DNA methylation, but these small effects may be better explained by genetic or lifestyle factors than a causal intrauterine mechanism. This highlights the need for large-scale collaborative approaches and the application of causal inference techniques in epigenetic epidemiology."

Volume: 48 Issue: 8 Dec 1988,1988,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/2853443/,"Both epidemiological and experimental studies have demonstrated that a high content of n-3 fatty acids in the diet lowers serum lipid concentration. However, the mechanism for this effect is unclear. In this present study it has been shown that labelled linolenic acid (18:3, n-3) is oxidized to a larger extent than linoleic acid (18:2,n-6) in isolated rat hepatocytes. Conversely, the incorporation of linolenic acid and the desaturated/chain-elongated products in VLDL-triacylglycerol is decreased compared with linoleic acid. Dietary n-3 fatty acids have probably a depressing effect on both hepatic triacylglycerol synthesis and on secretion of VLDL. The finding that n-3 fatty acids are transported from the liver as ketone bodies to a larger extent than n-6 fatty acids may thus explain that a high intake of n-3 fatty acids is not accompanied with hepatic steatosis."
751,Differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors anastrozole and letrozole--of clinical importance?,21364577,British journal of cancer. Volume: 104 Issue: 7 Mar 29 2011,2011,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/21364577/,"Aromatase inhibition is the gold standard for treatment of early and advanced breast cancer in postmenopausal women suffering from an estrogen receptor-positive disease. The currently established group of anti-aromatase compounds comprises two reversible aromatase inhibitors (anastrozole and letrozole) and on the other hand, the irreversible aromatase inactivator exemestane. Although exemestane is the only widely used aromatase inactivator at this stage, physicians very often have to choose between either anastrozole or letrozole in general practice. These third-generation aromatase inhibitors (letrozole/Femara (Novartis Pharmaceuticals, Basel, Switzerland) and anastrozole/Arimidex (AstraZeneca, Pharmaceuticals, Macclesfield, Cheshire, UK)), have recently demonstrated superior efficacy compared with tamoxifen as initial therapy for early breast cancer improving disease-free survival. However, although anastrozole and letrozole belong to the same pharmacological class of agents (triazoles), an increasing body of evidence suggests that these aromatase inhibitors are not equipotent when given in the clinically established doses. Preclinical and clinical evidence indicates distinct pharmacological profiles. Thus, this review focuses on the differences between the non-steroidal aromatase inhibitors allowing physicians to choose between these compounds based on scientific evidence. Although we are waiting for the important results of a still ongoing head-to-head comparison in patients with early breast cancer at high risk for relapse (Femara Anastrozole Clinical Evaluation trial; 'FACE-trial'), clinicians have to make their choices today. On the basis of available evidence summarised here and until FACE-data become available, letrozole seems to be the best choice for the majority of breast cancer patients whenever a non-steroidal aromatase inhibitor has to be chosen in a clinical setting. The background for this recommendation is discussed in the following chapters."

However, it is not known whether obesity mediates risk through shared mechanisms. In a population-based cohort, we aimed to compare the impact of obesity measures on risk of venous thromboembolism (VTE) and myocardial infarction (MI), and explore how obesity-related atherosclerotic risk factors influenced these relationships. Measures of body composition including body mass index , waist circumference (WC), hip circumference (HC), waist-hip ratio (WHR) and waist-to-height ratio (WHtR) were registered in 6,708 subjects aged 25-84 years, who participated in the Tromsø Study (1994-1995). Incident VTE- and MI-events were registered until January 1, 2011. There were 288 VTEs and 925 MIs during a median of 15.7 years of follow-up. All obesity measures were related to risk of VTE. In linear models, WC showed the highest risk estimates in both genders. In categorized models (highest versus lowest quintile), WC showed highest risk in men (HR 3.59; 95 % CI 1.82-7.06) and HC in women (HR 2.27; 95 % CI 1.54-4.92). Contrary, WHR and WHtR yielded the highest risk estimates for MI. The HR of MI (highest vs. lowest quintile) for WHR was 2.11 (95 % CI 1.59-2.81) in men and 1.62 (95 % CI 1.13-2.31) in women. The risk estimates for MI were substantially attenuated after adjustment for atherosclerotic risk factors, whereas the estimates for VTE remained unchanged. Our findings suggest that the impact of body fat distribution, and the causal pathway, differs for the association between obesity and arterial and venous thrombosis."

Volume: 50 Issue: 6 Dec 2014,2014,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/26988782/,"Macrocystis pyrifera is a widely distributed, highly productive, seaweed. It is known to use bicarbonate (HCO3 (-) ) from seawater in photosynthesis and the main mechanism of utilization is attributed to the external catalyzed dehydration of HCO3 (-) by the surface-bound enzyme carbonic anhydrase (CAext ). Here, we examined other putative HCO3 (-) uptake mechanisms in M. pyrifera under pHT 9.00 (HCO3 (-) : CO2  = 940:1) and pHT 7.65 (HCO3 (-) : CO2  = 51:1). Rates of photosynthesis, and internal CA (CAint ) and CAext activity were measured following the application of AZ which inhibits CAext , and DIDS which inhibits a different HCO3 (-) uptake system, via an anion exchange (AE) protein. We found that the main mechanism of HCO3 (-) uptake by M. pyrifera is via an AE protein, regardless of the HCO3 (-) : CO2 ratio, with CAext making little contribution. Inhibiting the AE protein led to a 55%-65% decrease in photosynthetic rates. Inhibiting both the AE protein and CAext at pHT 9.00 led to 80%-100% inhibition of photosynthesis, whereas at pHT 7.65, passive CO2 diffusion supported 33% of photosynthesis. CAint was active at pHT 7.65 and 9.00, and activity was always higher than CAext , because of its role in dehydrating HCO3 (-) to supply CO2 to RuBisCO. Interestingly, the main mechanism of HCO3 (-) uptake in M. pyrifera was different than that in other Laminariales studied (CAext -catalyzed reaction) and we suggest that species-specific knowledge of carbon uptake mechanisms is required in order to elucidate how seaweeds might respond to future changes in HCO3 (-) :CO2 due to ocean acidification.

Sixteen introns, at two distinct positions in the small-subunit (SSU) and large-subunit (LSU) rDNA, were sequenced and analyzed among the 29 taxa included in the initial screening. Genera found to contain introns were Botrytis, Dumontinia, Encoelia, Grovesinia, Myriosclerotinia, and Sclerotinia. Secondary-structure analyses of the group I introns concluded that all belong to the common IC1 subclass. Interestingly, the SSU rDNA intron from Myriosclerotinia caricisampullacea contains an insertion-like sequence extension which may be a relic of an open reading frame. Incongruent branching patterns of intron-based and rDNA-based (internal transcribed spacer) phylogenetic trees suggest that the fungal host genomes and the group I introns do not share a common evolutionary history. A model to explain how horizontal intron transfers may have occurred among the closely related fungal taxa is proposed."

Psychometric methods used in previous U.S. and Swedish studies were replicated. The response rate was 66%. The sample (mean age 62 years, mean disease duration 13 years) was over-represented by females (79%). Totally, 74% of the questionnaires were complete. Missing value rates per item ranged from 0.4% to 9.0% (mean 4.2%). In the Role-Emotional scale, all three items had missing value rates above average and higher than reported in the U.S. and Swedish studies. Tests of scaling assumptions confirmed the hypothesized structure of the questionnaire, but results were suboptimal in the General Health scale. In all scales the Cronbach's alphas exceeded the 0.70 standard for group comparisons. In the Physical Functioning scale, Cronbach's alpha exceeded the 0.90 standard for individual comparisons. There was good evidence for the construct validity of the questionnaire. Generally, the Norwegian SF-36 version 1.1 distributed to RA patients held the psychometric properties found in other countries and in normal populations.

We studied the role of kinins in the regulation of blood flow in the rat submandibular gland using a kinin analogue with antagonistic properties, [DArg0]Hyp3-Thi5-8[DPhe7]bradykinin. When infused into the carotid artery (20 micrograms/min/rat), this antagonist blocked the effect of bradykinin (25-250 ng/kg, intracarotid injection) on glandular blood flow. In nephrectomized rats, the antagonist also blocked the increase in glandular blood flow caused by enalaprilat, a kininase II converting enzyme inhibitor. At a dose of 20 micrograms/min/rat, the antagonist produced no detectable change in basal glandular blood flow; however, at a higher dose (100 micrograms/min/rat), it caused a significant decrease (p less than 0.001). In eight of 10 rats, blood flow decreased by 75% or more; this effect was not blocked by the alpha-adrenergic receptor antagonist phentolamine. After antagonist infusion was stopped, blood flow returned toward normal. Sympathetic nerve stimulation of the gland induced vasoconstriction followed by poststimulatory vasodilatation. In rats displaying severe vasoconstriction after the antagonist, postsympathetic vasodilatation was abolished even when stimulation was performed after the antagonist infusion had been stopped and blood flow returned toward normal. Although a direct vasoconstrictor effect of the kinin antagonist cannot be completely ruled out, these data suggest that, in the rat submandibular gland, kinins may play a role in regulation of basal blood flow and vasodilatation after converting enzyme inhibitor or sympathetic stimulation."

However, empirical data are lacking. We have examined the association between maternal folate and birth weight and assessed the mediating role of DNA methylation at nine differentially methylated regions (DMRs) of genomically imprinted genes in these associations. Compared with newborns of women with folate levels in the lowest quartile, birth weight was higher in newborns of mothers in the second (β = 143.2, se = 63.2, P = 0.02), third (β = 117.3, se = 64.0, P = 0.07), and fourth (β = 133.9, se = 65.2, P = 0.04) quartiles, consistent with a threshold effect. This pattern of association did not vary by race/ethnicity but was more apparent in newborns of non-obese women. DNA methylation at the PLAGL1, SGCE, DLK1/MEG3 and IGF2/H19 DMRs was associated with maternal folate levels and also birth weight, suggestive of threshold effects. MEG3 DMR methylation mediated the association between maternal folate levels and birth weight (P =0.06). While the small sample size and partial scope of examined DMRs limit our conclusions, our data suggest that, with respect to birth weight, no additional benefits may be derived from increased maternal folate concentrations, especially in non-obese women. These data also support epigenetic plasticity as a key mechanistic response to folate availability during early fetal development. "

Volume: 9 2018,2018,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29988529/,"Inflammation is a complicated biological and pathophysiological cascade of responses to infections and injuries, and inflammatory mechanisms are closely related to many diseases. The magnitude, the complicated network of pro- and anti-inflammatory factors, and the direction of the inflammatory response can impact on the development and progression of various disorders. The currently available treatment strategies often target the symptoms and not the causes of inflammatory disease and may often be ineffective. Since the onset and termination of inflammation are crucial to prevent tissue damage, a range of mechanisms has evolved in nature to regulate the process including negative and positive feedback loops. In this regard, microRNAs (miRNAs) have emerged as key gene regulators to control inflammation, and it is speculated that they are fine-tune signaling regulators to allow for proper resolution and prevent uncontrolled progress of inflammatory reactions. In this review, we discuss recent findings related to significant roles of miRNAs in immune regulation, especially the potential utility of these molecules as novel anti-inflammatory agents to treat inflammatory diseases. Furthermore, we discuss the possibilities of using miRNAs as drugs in the form of miRNA mimics or miRNA antagonists."

Cytogenetic abnormalities have been reported in 22 cases of ESS, mostly involving rearrangements of chromosomes 6, 7, and 17. The most characteristic translocation of this tumor type, t(7;17)(p15 approximately p21;q12 approximately q21), was recently shown to generate a JAZF1/JJAZ1 fusion gene. We report three additional cases of ESS with abnormal karyotypes, whose interpretation was based on the combined analysis by conventional cytogenetics and cross-species color banding FISH (RxFISH). The combination of G-banding and RxFISH in every case gave additional information beyond that obtained by either technique alone, determining the identity of even complex inter- as well as intrachromosomal rearrangements. In one of the three tumors, a t(7;17) was seen; molecular genetic studies identified the JAZF1/JJAZ1 fusion gene in this case. Two tumors had aberrations that included structural changes of chromosome arms 6p and 7p. Evidently, karyotypic, and hence pathogenetic, heterogeneity exists for tumors classified as endometrial stromal sarcomas based on their phenotypic features."

Here we report the effects of organic farming on species diversity at the field, farm and regional levels by sampling plants, earthworms, spiders and bees in 1470 fields of 205 randomly selected organic and nonorganic farms in twelve European and African regions. Species richness is, on average, 10.5% higher in organic than nonorganic production fields, with highest gains in intensive arable fields (around +45%). Gains to species richness are partly caused by higher organism abundance and are common in plants and bees but intermittent in earthworms and spiders. Average gains are marginal +4.6% at the farm and +3.1% at the regional level, even in intensive arable regions. Additional, targeted measures are therefore needed to fulfil the commitment of organic farming to benefit farmland biodiversity. "

An upper layer of grains displaces a lower gap of air by organizing into dense fingers of falling grains separated by rising bubbles of air. The dependence of these structures on the system and grain sizes is investigated. A spatial measurement of the finger structures is obtained by the Fourier power spectrum of the wave number k. As the size of the grains increases the wave number decreases accordingly which leaves the dimensionless product of wave number and grain diameter, dk, invariant. A theoretical interpretation of the invariance, based on the scaling properties of the model equations, suggests a gradual breakdown of the invariance for grains smaller than approximately 70 microm or greater than approximately 570 microm in diameter."

The material consisted of air-dried smears from 29 breast carcinomas and 3 breast cancer cell lines (MCF-7, SKBR3, and T47D). Chromogenic in situ hybridization (CISH) was done using chromogenic detection. The mean signal numbers for EGFR gene and chromosome 7 as well as the EGFR gene/chromosome 7 centromere probe (CEP7) ratio were recorded. Immunohistochemical (IHC) staining was done on the corresponding paraffin sections. The copy number of the EGFR gene in each tumor/cell line ranged from 1.2 to 5.6. The EGFR gene/CEP7 ratio showed a biological continuum ranging from 0.59 to 1.94 with a mean of 1.04. EGFR gene copy loss was found in 16.6% of cases whereas copy gain was demonstrated in 19.4%. There was no relationship between IHC protein expression of EGFR and EGFR gene copy number or EGFR gene/CEP7 ratio.In conclusion, most breast carcinomas had a balanced EGFR gene/CEP7 copy number with a mean ratio of 1.04. Almost equal subpopulations revealed limited copy gain and copy loss. EGFR high dosage amplification, like in HER-2, was not demonstrated. Demonstration of EGFR gene copy loss might have a potential as a surrogate marker for EGFR gene mutation and/or deletion."

Volume: 4 Issue: 8 Aug 2003",2003,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/12839497/,"The plant toxin ricin binds to both glycosphingolipids and glycoproteins with terminal galactose and is transported to the Golgi apparatus in a cholesterol-dependent manner. To explore the question of whether glycosphingolipid binding of ricin or glycosphingolipid synthesis is essential for transport of ricin from the plasma membrane to the Golgi apparatus, retrogradely to the endoplasmic reticulum or for translocation of the toxin to the cytosol, we have investigated the effect of ricin and the intracellular transport of this toxin in a glycosphingolipid-deficient mouse melanoma cell line (GM95), in the same cell line transfected with ceramide glucosyltransferase to restore glycosphingolipid synthesis (GM95-CGlcT-KKVK) and in the parental cell line (MEB4). Ricin transport to the Golgi apparatus was monitored by quantifying sulfation of a modified ricin molecule, and toxicity was studied by measuring protein synthesis. The data reveal that ricin is transported retrogradely to the Golgi apparatus and to the endoplasmic reticulum and translocated to the cytosol equally well and apparently at the same rate in cells with and without glycosphingolipids. Importantly cholesterol depletion reduced endosome to Golgi transport of ricin even in cells without glycosphingolipids, demonstrating that cholesterol is required for Golgi transport of ricin bound to glycoproteins. The rate of retrograde transport of ricin was increased strongly by monensin and the lag time for intoxication was reduced both in cells with and in those without glycosphingolipids. In conclusion, neither glycosphingolipid synthesis nor binding of ricin to glycosphingolipids is essential for cholesterol-dependent retrograde transport of ricin. Binding of ricin to glycoproteins is sufficient for all transport steps required for ricin intoxication."

One important barrier contributing to this inactivity is lack of motivation. The aim of this paper is to systematically review all cross-sectional literature on motivation for physical activity among people with SMI and to use the results as basis for guidance on how mental health nurses can facilitate motivation for physical activity. Systematic searches of seven databases were conducted from database inception to February 2015. Studies were eligible if they included participants with SMI and reported data on motivation for physical activity. In total, 21 articles were included and over half them were published in 2011 or later. The present results indicate preliminary evidence of how the motivational processes do not differ between individuals with SMI and the general population, and that they are independent of diagnosis, medication, age, gender, and body mass index. Results from the current systematic review can give some tentative guidance on how to facilitate motivation for physical activity within mental health-care. However, there is still a great need for developing and examining practical strategies that can enhance adoption and adherence of physical activity among people with SMI."

Volume: 6 06 21 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/27324690/,"Previous analyses of the Atlantic cod genome showed unique combinations of lacking and expanded number of genes for the immune system. The present study examined lysozyme activity, lysozyme gene distribution and expression in cod. Enzymatic assays employing specific bacterial lysozyme inhibitors provided evidence for presence of g-type, but unexpectedly not for c-type lysozyme activity. Database homology searches failed to identify any c-type lysozyme gene in the cod genome or in expressed sequence tags from cod. In contrast, we identified four g-type lysozyme genes (LygF1a-d) constitutively expressed, although differentially, in all cod organs examined. The active site glutamate residue is replaced by alanine in LygF1a, thus making it enzymatic inactive, while LygF1d was found in two active site variants carrying alanine or glutamate, respectively. In vitro and in vivo infection by the intracellular bacterium Francisella noatunensis gave a significantly reduced LygF1a and b expression but increased expression of the LygF1c and d genes as did also the interferon gamma (IFNγ) cytokine. These results demonstrate a lack of c-type lysozyme that is unprecedented among vertebrates. Our results further indicate that serial gene duplications have produced multiple differentially regulated cod g-type lysozymes with specialised functions potentially compensating for the lack of c-type lysozymes."

Volume: 21 Issue: 4 07 2016,2016,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25752199/,"Individuals with attention deficit/hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) are at increased risk of developing substance use disorders (SUDs) and nicotine dependence. The co-occurrence of ADHD and SUDs/nicotine dependence may in part be mediated by shared genetic liability. Several neurobiological pathways have been implicated in both ADHD and SUDs, including dopamine and serotonin pathways. We hypothesized that variations in dopamine and serotonin neurotransmission genes were involved in the genetic liability to develop SUDs/nicotine dependence in ADHD. The current study included participants with ADHD (n = 280) who were originally part of the Dutch International Multicenter ADHD Genetics study. Participants were aged 5-15 years and attending outpatient clinics at enrollment in the study. Diagnoses of ADHD, SUDs, nicotine dependence, age of first nicotine and substance use, and alcohol use severity were based on semi-structured interviews and questionnaires. Genetic risk scores were created for both serotonergic and dopaminergic risk genes previously shown to be associated with ADHD and SUDs and/or nicotine dependence. The serotonin genetic risk score significantly predicted alcohol use severity. No significant serotonin × dopamine risk score or effect of stimulant medication was found. The current study adds to the literature by providing insight into genetic underpinnings of the co-morbidity of ADHD and SUDs. While the focus of the literature so far has been mostly on dopamine, our study suggests that serotonin may also play a role in the relationship between these disorders."

Volume: 343 Issue: 2 Feb 04 2008,2008,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/18048017/,"In this study, dynamic light scattering (DLS), turbidity, and rheo-small angle light scattering (rheo-SALS) methods have been utilized to examine the impact of pH (1 < or = pH < or = 7) on aqueous solutions of noncommercial purified pig gastric mucin. The asymmetric flow field-flow fractionation (AFFFF) measurements established that the mucin sample has a high molecular weight and is polydisperse. DLS measurements on dilute solutions of mucin disclosed large interchain aggregates at pH 2, where the polymer has a low charge density or is uncharged. At lower or higher values of pH, mucin is charged and the tendency of forming interpolymer complexes is affected. In the semidilute concentration regime, pronounced junction zones ('lumps' of polymer) are evolved and a heterogeneous connected network is formed at pH 2, whereas the association structures are disintegrated (smaller 'lumps') at lower or higher pH values due to electrostatic repulsive interactions, and a more homogeneous network is evolved. The DLS and viscosity results at pH 1 indicate the development of a fragmented network, composed of contracted chains that are decorated by some positive charges. The effect of shear flow on the structure of semidilute solutions of mucin was investigated with the aid of rheo-SALS methods. The scattered intensity revealed a strong upturn at low values of the wave vector (q) for mucin solutions at pH 2 and pH 4, which suggests the evolution of large association domains. At these pH values, a flow-induced anisotropy in the 2D SALS patterns in the form of elliptical shapes was observed at high shear rates."

Volume: 157 Issue: 2 Jun 1996,1996,http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/8800369/,"To examine whether sodium reabsorption in the thick ascending limb of Henle's loop (TALH) in the dog kidney has a passive component, the ratios between reductions in sodium reabsorption and oxygen consumption (delta Na/delta Qo2 ratio) were measured by inhibiting tubular transport with bumetanide (30 micrograms kg-1) and ouabain (120 ng kg-1 intrarenally). Clearance studies were performed in volume expanded dogs treated with acetazolamide (100 mg kg-1) or maleate (400 mg kg-1). In five acetazolamide-treated dogs, bumetanide gave a delta Na/delta Qo2 ratio of 29.9 +/- 2.5, whereas the combination of bumetanide and ouabain gave 19.0 +/- 0.6. When ouabain was given before bumetanide, ouabain gave a delta Na/delta Qo2 ratio of 19.2 +/- 1.1 and the combination gave 19.9 +/- 1.2. In the maleate-treated dogs, bumetanide gave a delta Na/Qo2 ratio 30.3 +/- 1.7, and the combination of bumetanide and ouabain gave 27.1 +/- 1.5. To localize the metabolic effect of bumetanide and ouabain, local heat production was measured at 18 places in four kidneys with copper-constantan thermocouples. Bumetanide reduced metabolic rate in the outer medulla by 51 +/- 4%, and in the cortex by 16 +/- 6%. Subsequent infusion of ouabain reduced metabolic rate in the outer medulla by only 9 +/- 3%, whereas cortical metabolism was reduced by 33 +/- 4%. The results show that bumetanide mainly acts in the outer medullar where TALH is located, whereas the additional effect of ouabain is mainly located in cortical segment of the nephron including the proximal tubules. Bumetanide inhibits the reabsorption of 30 mol sodium for each mole oxygen consumed, which show that for each 18 mol sodium that are transported through the cells in the TALH in dog kidneys. 12 mol (40%) are transported along the paracellular route without additional requirement of energy."

Children who have this disorder have difficulties regarding regulation of their emotions, maintaining attention and impulse control. Parents may need guidance in creating structure and predictable boundaries. One of the personnel who meet these families is the public health nurse. The aim of this study was to explore the public health nurses role in relation to these families. A qualitative explorative design with a phenomenographic approach was used. Interviews were performed with 19 nurses, six in group and one individual. In the data analyses, three descriptive categories emerged: 'supporting the family-unit', which describes the nurses supervising the parents and the child in everyday challenges; 'understanding the child', which describes how the public health nurses use professional competence and choose the time and arena to observe the child and; 'collaborating multidisciplinary', which describes how the public health nurses define their own role and conceive their collaboration with other professionals. The public health nurse (PHN)'s support for the parents and the entire family is important, and the PHN is the first encounter and trustful follower throughout the course of diagnosis and care. "

Empirical analysis uses individual-level panel data covering health screenings of public schoolchildren from Arkansas with annual georeferenced business lists, and utilizes the variations of supermarket openings and closings. There is little overall impact in either case. However, supermarket openings are found to reduce the BMI z-scores of low-income children by 0.090 to 0.096 standard deviations. Such impact remains in a variety of robustness exercises. Therefore, improvement in healthy food access could at least help reduce childhood obesity rates among certain population groups."

Such participation is often justified by the claim that civil society organizations, because of their independence and links to communities, can help address democratic deficits in global-level decision-making processes. This article examines the notion of 'civil society engagement' within major public-private partnerships for health, where civil society is often said to play a particularly important role in mediating between public and private spheres. How do major global health partnerships actually define 'civil society', who represents civil society within their global-level decision-making bodies, and what formal power do civil society representatives hold relative to other public and private-sector partners? Based on a structured analysis of publicly available documents of 18 of the largest global public-private partnerships for health, we show that many of them make laudatory claims about the value of their 'civil society engagement'. Most use the term 'civil society' to refer to non-governmental organizations and communities affected by particular health issues, and state that they expect these actors to represent the needs and interests of specific populations in global-level decisions about strategies, funding models and policies. Yet, such civil society actors have a relatively low level of representation within the partnerships' boards and steering committees, especially compared with private-sector actors (10.3 vs 23.7%). Moreover, there is little evidence of civil society representatives' direct and substantial influence within the partnerships' global-level governing bodies, where many decisions affecting country-level programmes are made. Rather, their main role within these partnerships seems to be to implement projects and advocate and raise funds, despite common discourses that emphasise civil society's watchdog function and transformative power. The findings suggest the need for in-depth research into the formal and informal power of civil society within global health governance processes."

The current study aims to assess the degree to which the personality trait of negative affectivity in mothers predicts their child's diet at age 18 months. This study is a part of the Norwegian Mother and Child Cohort Study conducted at the Norwegian Institute of Public Health. A total of 27 763 mothers completed 3 repeated assessments of negative affectivity before and after childbirth and of the child's diet when the child was 18 months old. Exploratory factor analysis was used to identify the dietary patterns, and structural equation modeling was used to investigate the relationship with negative affectivity adjusted for socio-demographical variables. Exploratory factor analysis of a foods frequency questionnaire revealed two dietary patterns in the child, labeled unhealthy diet and wholesome diet. The unhealthy diet comprised foods rich in sugar and fat; the wholesome diet comprised foods rich in fibre, vitamins and minerals. Mothers high in negative affectivity were more inclined to feed their child an unhealthy diet. The results were adjusted for maternal age, years of education, relative income, marital status, number of children, having the child in daycare, maternal smoking, maternal body mass index, and child gender. This study shows that a maternal personality trait, negative affectivity, is related to feeding the child an unhealthy diet after controlling for key socio-demographic variables."

CDM is often portrayed in the literature as similar to 'trail blazing'; the doctor as the core agent, clearing away obstacles on the path towards diagnosis and treatment. However, in a fieldwork of young doctors in Denmark, it was difficult connect their practice to this image. This paper presents the exploration of this discrepancy in the heart of medical practice and how an alternative image emerged; that of a 'jam session'. The exploration is represented as a case-based hypothesis-testing: first, a theoretically and empirically informed hypothesis (H0) of how doctors perform CDM is developed. In H0, CDM is a stepwise process of reasoning about clinical data, often influenced by outside contextual factors. Then, H0 is tested against a case from ethnographic fieldwork with doctors going through internship. Although the case is chosen for characteristics that make it 'most likely' to verify the hypothesis, verification proves difficult. The case challenges preconceptions in CDM literature about chronology, context, objectivity, cognition, agency, and practice. The young doctor is found not to make decisions, but rather to participate in CDM; an activity akin to the dynamics found in a jam session. Their participation circles in and through four concurrent interrelated constructions that suggest a new conceptualization of CDM; a starting point for a deeper understanding of actual practice in a changing clinical environment."
